You know that what I do is to write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, and read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> it like farmer, or leather <unk> and never no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that a singular epiphany is generally something that you fell somewhere there.
You just have to turn on the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the middle school in the middle school, in <unk> <unk> where I was the rare person in class.
When I was going to put it up to bleed every week in the bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom <unk>
I did it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb and 85 dollars, and I ended in San Francisco, California -- found a lover -- and in the years I felt the need to begin to work in organizations that were fighting to AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I received a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm sure that we adults never get to know us.
You could <unk> Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you've ever found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I'd like you to tell you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we were <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it a place, the <unk> and we got it away from their family, because necessary, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany of which I told you about was made in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I went for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly -- trying to understand what was in front of me.
The <unk> to me about <unk> water almost 60 feet, and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> of snow after year.
<unk> are born when they fall from the glaciers or they break up the ice shelves, they are.
Each iceberg has its individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of you refuse to give up and hold up to the end, while others can't afford them more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, by looking at a <unk> who are isolated and <unk> as much as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> melts in, I'm breathing its <unk> atmosphere.
As an iceberg melts by sweet water that feeds on so many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are just that and they'll never exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> that photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are from an iceberg that I photographed on <unk> Greenland.
It's very often to get to see an <unk> iceberg here.
Here it is.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line line.
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an <unk> iceberg <unk>
It's about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> a baby.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to go too much in the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about the conception of good, you're not going to pay attention to it.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome of sperm joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll get back to them later.
In my activity that will be two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> training and what I study in this case is the way people are doing the anatomy -- you know, human bodies and <unk> how have you considered the body fluids.
The other role that you do in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with twins -- two people inside one body.
I've been working with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physical typology doesn't fit into the male <unk> and conventional <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> many ways.
I'm going to put a few examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't lie in common forms or female.
For example, the case is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose gene <unk> of the chromosome and says to the <unk> that we all have in life <unk> that <unk>
And then, in life we will destroy the testes produce testosterone.
But because this individual doesn't react to testosterone, body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high testosterone levels, but without reaction.
As a result, the body develops on following a <unk> <unk>
When you get it, the baby looks like a child.
It's a child, it's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing breast cancer, but it doesn't have the menstrual period when somebody realizes something is happening.
After drawing tests realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> it actually has <unk> and a <unk>
What's important to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like this.
Women, as men, we have in the body something called <unk> glands
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce the hormone of the <unk>
Most women like I -- I was -- I consider a young woman who does not know his structure, and I think it's a typical woman, most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> than the woman was born with testicles that have <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some ways they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised as <unk> he had her girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, was wearing a life as guy, and I had just found that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had bacterial chromosomes and the uterus, the <unk> glands were so active that, which essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a result, their genitalia was <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> anything.
And it was in the age of 19 when he started to have caused medical problems by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, she was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with Global chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> which is to say, have tissue <unk> wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know how well that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- I think they're <unk> twins or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> is not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why you get into several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have identity <unk> <unk> being black wants to say to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A very simplistic idea.
And when you show us a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture to the <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic concept of <unk>
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people inside one body.
The highest recent case is last year in the past year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put on the <unk> <unk> sex on <unk>
Many journalists called to wonder: "What test are you going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to journalists that don't have such a test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or men and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more progress we have to do science, we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were <unk> <unk> categories that will spread directly with <unk> categories are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that makes a lot more complicated than the terminology of the terminology at all.
So as we see, we go into a <unk> ground.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of the <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we <unk> in science we get more and more in a uncomfortable area where we have to recognize that <unk> categories are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in the United States today is the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are a lot of <unk> discussions today -- not in public, not in public, but I know within <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to come up with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of you put a pen in front of the nose and if you move it still not <unk>
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them on another body.
And as a result, we need to deal with the dilemma of really understanding death else's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe you think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, <unk> to people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit to you nervous.
It turns out that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about me.
It was from the concept point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of Founding <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, that I find each other watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with the Founding <unk>
The Founding <unk> was out to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they did -- it was a <unk> concept and it <unk> it with another that it was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And, as everybody recall, what our Founding <unk> was the idea of <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs from the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the Internet of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were the idea that it was the political power of the blood of blood passed from the grandfather by the father and then the son, and so on.
The Founding <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it by a new concept, <unk> and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They would play the game game and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> <unk> That was very radical.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were getting together two things.
It was <unk> democracy and the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the story of the Founding <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of the explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of <unk> power passed through a vague <unk> idea of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence and talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a consequence they were broadcasting us the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing that, they were <unk> the foundations of the future of Civil Rights movement.
They didn't think that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women.
Then he came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights Movement by saying, "I'm a man."
Again, people of color who are talking to <unk> <unk> about the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we maintain certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish for the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we should be socializing to anatomy.
I don't mean that at the age of five years they were supposed to have sex or <unk>
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two creatures, at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before I time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, the opposite, was born in term: was born the March March of July 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary was attributed to all three months before Henry -- the right to sexual <unk> the right to <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different age, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, at virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> at virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the advice that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
<unk> on the hand, has no human rights that Henry in every states, for example.
Henry can marry every states with a woman, but Mary can marry one woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories of <unk> that in many ways, are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went through so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time, sometimes I feel like science <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It looks like what happens in our culture is kind of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people have stuck in a rare position.
For example, Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man doesn't have to have chromosome and to marry a woman you have to have the Y.
Now, in practice they do not make <unk> tests to people.
But this is also very strange because the story that I told you to the principle of <unk> syndrome.
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I would say to <unk> offers a solution.
He says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but on the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks pretty good."
But in practice, how do you do that?
How do you judge people based on the contents of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be able to focus on this for us to make rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more decisions and smart and <unk> about their sex relationships than I know.
So how do we put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very difficult.
And a part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context as the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless he is willing to have change in sex, in which case it allows him to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made light twins <unk> and then they were able to pick up their name.
But when I was asked by the phone, it was a very famous operation, he told me that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
And I said, "Well, it's considered political asylum instead of <unk>
America offers huge possibilities for people to be who are <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we have to be on your head.
Well, I want to say that I've been talking about a lot of the <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit of radical for a theremin and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about them.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigating sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operating in the world.
And what we know about studying studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers I had to know that I was interested in feminism <unk> I was considered <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about women's <unk>
And I thought, "It's the dumbest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's no female in the <unk>
But the more I have thought about her question, the more I have seemed to have something else in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something different on average, something different between your brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while the Founding were very attentive to find out how to protect people from the state, it is possible that we had put more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the support of support of support for support.
And maybe that is what we need to do in the future when we bring democracy beyond the <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So while we try to create a more perfect, let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family to think about where you want to go to live and work, have the possibility of choice between least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents.
Well, right now, we're far from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth much more than its cost cost.
So we could easily address the world -- perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may be absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But we just embraced by building buildings.
Imagine that half of those people who wanted to live in apartments were already owners and to the other half of us still fail to do it.
They could try to increase the ability by making <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that you think about is that those buildings and the areas that are around have rules to avoid the <unk> and the building distractions at the construction.
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a whole new place, and build a completely new, new apartment building -- always and when the rules of that set place to be able to do it rather than putting it in.
So I proposed that governments -- new areas of reform big enough to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened for a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the next <unk> elections in the following presidential election, we imposed it with a platform in which <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his boss of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of the standards, like those rules that say that you can't go and take them to all the current residents of apartments.
We have a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies as to <unk> and it's usually the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link to the <unk>
He showed him to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
And so in December we met in Miami, in a conference room of a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities are, much more valuable than its cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City. In some cases, that's worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, and he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with dry terrain -- a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are being stored there and a choice for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going to be.
He asked me to go to <unk> and I would talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which was an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport is covers over 100 square kilometers.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is measuring at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
Everybody's <unk>
The faces of the audience were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have it here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained to you that a new city can provide new choices for people.
There would be a choice for a city that you could go in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the north.
And also new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of <unk> government would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from the countries associated with them and help them make the norms of the <unk> so that they could all trust that the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is out there.
It could easily eliminate a thousand square kilometers.
And shortly after the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement to allow us to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just been going through this crisis <unk> the voting in Congress for this constitutional <unk> to this constitutional <unk>
All the parties, all the planets in society, <unk>
To <unk> the Constitution has to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 passed over again in other voting voting on one.
Immediately after the voting is from 21 to 24 in February, a <unk> of about 30 <unk> went to the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new large center of the city that's building in Korea, it's bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after four years were getting the <unk>
The other interest in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this <unk> this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and you're thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and it would allow the <unk> to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allowing its Supreme Court to allow their Supreme Court to be the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There are urban planners and builders which are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've been solving is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are lots of companies that want to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to switch to the other place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to their family to get a job -- sometimes they're unwed mothers who have to earn money for just to eat or buy clothes.
Sadly, there's even children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What do you think about insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> asked me to say, "Thank TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is, I'm going to make a public confession -- which is that, I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, and more recently, photographing and publish and publish my blog <unk> and colorful and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and shops.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet people -- I mean, usually my money is going to a good <unk> and my view is <unk> and buying it into my personal quest for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'll be from my size?
I like the <unk>
It cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are <unk> then I feel I won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what we're going to do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I brought seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
It runs inside exactly a week that's all I've put on my <unk>
I imagined that I would be able to find everything else that I want to use after getting here to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know me like the woman walking at TED in the inner underwear,  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you the data for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see it for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a brilliant red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people right now, you don't just give you <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember her <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key thing.
If you think you look good at something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't do well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your interior and outside, there is no look that you can't do it."
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We should be able to do everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal words for you: The gold <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again, when people approached me this week just so I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we need to leave certain things.
I don't need to pay attention to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> if there is a little bit of love in my heart and I come up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So, if you put a scale to measure the <unk> of every single <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where are your brain at this scale?
Some of them are <unk> by one of the extreme ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that being mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
And I consider one of those people, which as most of the other quantum physicists -- we need quite a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need pretty intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We can play with them and then we see it as <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
So as a form of intuition that you can have developed over the age of the years is that it says that one thing can be only in a place at a time.
I mean, it might sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
So I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a little boy, and it didn't really do it very well, it was always <unk>
But I bet playing with that bar <unk> I showed you a little bit of a remarkable lesson, and that is that big things don't allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a big conceptual model, except you can be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particles, because they don't play with parking bars and they play with these little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called them theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics a few years long you needed from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because it's not very often with particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, you never saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit my way to my logic.
Because if it's all made of small particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't be all of the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why I shouldn't have been.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why some years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's right at the center.
And then here we do a very large focus on the small metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal, with a springboard and a springboard and <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a chip in silicon new, and I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a form of <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of rare things, but then when other people go up, let me leave you from doing those things, because I don't want to eat them, or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> of the <unk> objects are not only people, it's also the light that <unk> it and the wind going on the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
They set out the lights and then <unk> a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and then it would take it back to a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when I'm just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured their movements.
We found that moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was vibrating. and the way it <unk> was like a breath in this way -- as a <unk> that it expands and <unk>
And by giving him a smooth thrust, we were able to make it <unk> and that didn't take the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing is <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think of atoms.
In one case, all the trillion of atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just at certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It was worth <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look, the difference on scale between one atom and that piece of metal is sort of the same as the difference between that metal and you are.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my kind of logic that he talks about.
So imagine if you were in a number of places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you act if your body is <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all objects in the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss that's here and allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months to me.
A lot of negotiations and stories, they did it with 17 museums -- very interesting countries about nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did it.
I think my own story is explaining simply in this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better to show you the demo, and then to explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done from their launch.
So, let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
Is the gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, <unk> the New York art museum here.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click on and <unk> we're inside the museum.
No matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open the top, and with a single click, we jumped in.
They're inside, that you want to go at the end of the hall,
They continue to go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings -- "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here is all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click there right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you actually get with 10,000 million pixels.
It can zoom around in a very simple way.
You see funny things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have price.
But if you really want to do it.
So I started playing play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
I walked in, and I found that the kids were actually actually playing something.
And I did a little bit of a little bit of a few people in the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick on the <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get deeper even deeper into a depth and you'll see that you can actually get even the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take away the image, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best one is coming, a second.
So now we're rapidly going to jump again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The <unk>
The example I showed you was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this piece of <unk>
It goes up and truth that we will.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot more things here, but I don't have time for <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives the same.
You can find your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked in -- I've created this function I call "The <unk> of <unk> -- we've just got a zoom in here.
It's about "The <unk> in the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you consider these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, in my view, they don't come from museums either.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital means to make the work of art and that is represented in line.
And the big question I'm doing today is, "You can do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
So think it's a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, I'm in Italian, all the kids in Italy grew up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened really interesting to the next two decades.
But sometime ago, if you wanted to win a year of Formula 1, I would take a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the race.
This is what it is that in engineering, we have control system control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks.
They're becoming <unk>
And as <unk> they're starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex on the planet but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be something big.
Beyond the cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for a year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start to <unk>
In a way, it's kind of like almost all the existing atoms in the ground and <unk>
And that is completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In some sense it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end I took the hammer and he threw it on the Moses -- you can actually see a little <unk> <unk> and he said to <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just some <unk> insisting on the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of 2006.
It was the year when Italy, won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of you remember, they were playing Italy and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at the activity that happens in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is in the top.
In the late afternoon, there are people over here and there will call <unk>
It starts the silence.
<unk> of France.
<unk> people does a fast phone call.
<unk> End of time.
First time <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They win Italy, yeah!
That night everybody went to <unk> to the center.
There's the big summit.
The next day everyone went into the center of the British team and the prime minister then.
And then the whole world.
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we could not have been able to do just a few years.
Another quick example of <unk> it's not about people, but about things we use and consume them.
Today, we know all about the equivalent of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how they <unk>
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in their change by the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago, to tag what were different kinds of things, as you can see, things that were all going on.
And then we put a little chip, one tag on the trash and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist.
There are complicated things, and there's a lot of transportation available.
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we throw out of it, is still somewhere on the planet.
And if the plastic bottle we throw down one day still follows there.
That if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague from MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about at the very beginning, which is <unk> about the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question from the mayor of the city, who came up and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water using water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology can be, the new technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> valves from <unk> <unk> <unk> open and <unk>
It creates like a broken water, with the pixels of water.
If you fall on the pixels and you can write them in them, show patterns, images, texts.
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can happen in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And they took a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no doors or windows, but when you're approaching it opens up so you can go through.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there is a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> down the roof.
Or you can close the building and the whole architecture disappears, as in this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody in the winter, when you go down the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost all the architecture goes down.
Here it's working.
You see the people who are going on with what happens in it.
And here I am trying to do not the test of proving sensors that open water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the kids in <unk> came to the building, because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let me happen, but a building that was still doing <unk> and water holes and one had to jump to <unk>
<unk> noise) And for us that was really interesting because you like architects, engineers, designers, we always think about using people to give our designs?
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels the missing pixels and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air, and that each one of you had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that's moving into space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like that we saw before, that moves with others in sync.
Could we form this cloud,
And a kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal -- but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen would appear in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of missing pixels to the one you can end up and look at them and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light turns out, you see this -- the same thing we saw before.
Imagine each one of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers dancers of today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use them as input for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> capture it in different <unk>
It's so much 3D <unk> in real time as it capture.
It can spread all the movement.
You can run all the way.
And once we have the pixels to play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> farm like <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could do that we could all take a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what it has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can move from the digital world, from the power to the <unk> to the physical world.
In our case, this might be able to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think of climate change or the emissions of CO2. How will you move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud they're pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but on the pixels.
You can move inside the inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, serve to share the main moments of the Olympics of 2012 and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something you can rise up, like a new <unk>
You can go into there.
Like a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they could improve the <unk> for more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, to be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and safe <unk>
What about good health?
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What are you going to tell you about it?
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people are they <unk> creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> I probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would you choose <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of us, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a funny topic here at the TED Conference but I want to give you the look at a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "No sense of <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution, consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
It's about the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end, is of course what interests us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
There have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, mostly the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin protein that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human <unk> but it is the same protein, that comes out of <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all have in the most bacteria that the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> tells you about the <unk> you think about the <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully formalized environment for those bacteria.
It's warm up, dark, <unk> <unk>
And we're going to provide them all the nutrients that can want to want no effort to <unk>
It's actually like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some hasten <unk> towards the way.
But by the way, we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, a better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on the Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single single one and only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope that you've been <unk>
When I just went to college I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental about most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms -- every cell is simply splitting and all the genetic energy from that cell is transmitted to the two normal cells.
But when organisms come, things start to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the body comes into evolution in the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> death by <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still lie in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night somebody hits his door of hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of it, you find a gorgeous dancer, of clothes.
He looks at him and says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He said, "He's doing George, I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted them to be healthy.
I wanted to recover health into disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution consists of passing the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets that are designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think we all <unk> the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you don't know.
Evolution doesn't necessarily lead to longevity.
It doesn't necessarily lead to the biggest or the strongest or the faster and even the smarter.
Evolution encourages the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only job of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> that they can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish in there, fish <unk> and yet they've managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we come back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution -- and in particular, if we look at the <unk> phase -- I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that you don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've learned to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and taken from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we've built our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, we <unk> <unk> and we become so possible that it's no longer possible to have the isolation necessary for evolution.
A second possibility is that you make a evolution of traditional type, natural type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of the <unk> when the species <unk> distant planets are going to exist to exist, isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there's a third possibility, a possibility, and intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the decisions that we make.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more male males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what you pick up on the individual and family level.
Think of it as well as you might be able to choose not just the sex of their <unk> but in your own body making the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could make the genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or to reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If you look at the future that kind of changes will be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and he sued 13.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year to be finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost of close to 20,000 dollars, and in a week.
Not much to be a lot of us to make the human genome for <unk> and to be increasingly in order to everyone.
These changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the vaccine against <unk> <unk> in cells from a tobacco plant.
You can imagine something nice that comes out of the <unk>
That's reality today and in the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only two little <unk>
They can change the cells from their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if they could change sperm and <unk> or to change the <unk> egg and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, remove your diabetes, remove the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology, that same motor of science that can produce changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of <unk> <unk> especially if you were able to deal with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer.
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions of introducing this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we want to have become the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years, and we can take it back to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to them.
We're going to use these choices to make a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, let's choose to selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that's more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deeper thing of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For a good or for worse, and before what you could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine by doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only thing I could talk to with flight.
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "There is no problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had taken off the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot was <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Often it's the road.
It was the engines.
Imagine being on an airplane and <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three more <unk> words I've ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to speak more with the flight.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get in and I didn't do it, all the fences that I want to take care of all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
While I was thinking about that later on, I came up a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll just open.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that way, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is while <unk> the bridge George Washington -- that wasn't much -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve all I did.
But in my humanity also give me place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I was doing things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then I decided to get rid of the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm no longer trying to have <unk> <unk> will be <unk>
The third thing that I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is going down <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And while <unk> I had the feeling of, Wow, die doesn't day fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to love myself, I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> as a small child.
And for me, that was all the reason for the world.
At that point I realized when I understood those two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For everything, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was awarded a miracle, not to die that day.
And I gave my other gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and going back and live in another way.
You guys are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens to you in your plane -- and please not be that -- but you can imagine, and how do you care?
What is it that they are still expecting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How does your relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents that I had.
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with lots of projects.
But the most great thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the world's most important <unk>
And one day he came to her home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the dawn of ALS.
Today <unk> has total paralysis today.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design firm and animation so that, obviously, graffiti is a bit of intricate we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and meet his brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he is able to communicate with me."
And I said, "Wait a second, not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be a big person, and you have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate from that way, they go <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I showed up with the only desire to deliver a check and instead he signed a check that had no idea how I was going to <unk>
I joined his brother and her father in that right moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk about, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much in your inner inner cannot be able to do it.
So I spoke at a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research -- that have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface, and then with a laser pointer to draw on that and record the negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle of life.
They start with sexual organs, then with bad words, after the Bush attacks, and at the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life in his <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and so much moving things on one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the gates of insurance companies and we got a machine that you could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy -- you get an email from it, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was bring to seven programmers around the world <unk> from every single corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, kids and I, we moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took over the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something totally stupid and that when you would have taken away the frames on the walls and in their place would have been pulled out of it.
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> walk of <unk> my son was part of my dog -- and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a little pair of cheap sun <unk> that we buy on the walk of <unk> Beach, some copper copper and <unk> things and <unk> <unk>
We take a camera <unk> we put it together on a light light, and now there's a device that is free -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- and you build the code -- we published the software code, the software goes down in free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company to say "No."
There is no hospital that can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning -- two weeks of computer programming, I went back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system, and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot out of the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take on the parking lot, so we had to look as if we were doing graffiti as well.
And at the end of this he gave us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I was an <unk>
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody finally came to me and get me out there so I could have a <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion, you know.
And we have a long way to go through this.
This is a cool device but it's the equivalent of a logarithmic spider.
Someone with this artistic potential deserves much more.
That's why we're trying to figure out how to build and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were the <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us like one of the top 50 inventions in 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up with the <unk> is that in April of this year at the <unk> of <unk> at the center of Los Angeles there is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> in urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, do it happen.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with recognition technology I just recognized something and <unk> me with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want all of us to do every day when we find something that we feel that we need to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in generally very difficult situations and at the same time as dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just a fun thing at the beginning, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been tracking myself in very awful situations with the only goal to treat.
So when I knew I would come up here to make a TEDTalk about the world of brands and the country -- I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard of them, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some text messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights for the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What was the following: It was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it comes to and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company doing it.
But said this, it's a very good opportunity to do.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights for name.
If I had asked him a year ago, I couldn't have been able to do it for certain.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing, <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> nothing could <unk> for something as difficult or dangerous to go into the rooms with these kinds.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that deals with the <unk> of products, the marketing and advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> of marketing and marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The <unk> of ever <unk> is that everything from up to the bottom, from beginning to end, it has brand images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title title, the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> That's what? <unk> It's <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> I just did it. It was more for <unk>
He was <unk> for forever."
But we're not just going to have the flag of the X brand in the degree, but we're going to make sure to give it all the categories that we can on the film.
You may be able to take a shoe and become the most cool shoe that you've ever met.
The most great car that you've driven in "The largest film has ever been <unk> the best drop of <unk> from "The largest movie ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, to make them <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is the transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the full idea, all the film, the beginning of beginning to end.
And I would love to help you, help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how fast it is going to be the people.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> No <unk> How much money does it take to do this?
MS: A million and a half <unk> <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth that worth to convince a couple of big brand.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that film is going to look at us as a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be hard for <unk> for the film or being I?
JK:
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome. Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to do it.
MK: We have some places where he go, <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought that <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies were suddenly gone.
No one wanted nothing to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know nothing with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, to make so much as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the landscape of the separate media is not the idea to tell that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a mistake, and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of Google in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first pictures that are coming up.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey Brin: No.
This was the problem: the <unk> free of simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which are characterized by visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices as the last line is perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president, <unk> even the <unk> <unk>
But all of a sudden, when it comes to it all of a sudden it changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency da <unk>  like that weird bear that still follows <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell them that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> story.
We want to make a story, but we want to make a story, but <unk> story."
See, when I was a child, and my father would get me in some lie -- and there he is watching me as he used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and there's history <unk>
As you see, in this film, we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, a agency wanted to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> in many years -- I realized I would have to go on my own account, I would have to take away and go to companies with my whole team.
So what I started to tell you to all of a sudden -- and I started giving me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, huge <unk> and others who do small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make films of <unk> big Hollywood say that the reason their movies have so much success is because of the brands associated with them.
And then my friends who make independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the film?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any point during an interview with someone I can tell you "Are you cool cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You look a little bit nervous.
I want to help you get to you.
Maybe you should put a little bit before the <unk>
And there will offer one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> of the <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man like <unk> and <unk> to <unk> to <unk> like that.
That's the general overview.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: Are we a little brand.
It brings up the kind of little films that we had, we are more well a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that they have other brands.
So do things like that, you know, remind people this is why this interests you.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a big question.
Volunteer: technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something new, cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category into positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you very cool.
How do we keep them cool away longer?
Things like those who are <unk>
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of common?
I need to talk to the man in the street, to people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to talk to me about my brand.
MS: How do you define yourself your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like <unk>
Woman: revive the 1980s, the 1980s, unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> A little bit of <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the colored colors -- many gray colors and things like that.
Usually I carry <unk> like sunglasses, or I like the crystals and the similar.
Woman: If Dan was a brand -- it could be a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: Man 2: I would call him <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part of <unk> partly <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pet guy.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be an artist, but I often stand up at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call the <unk> of <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality of brand.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family photo.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people form a way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world that we <unk> like the people around you, your family, the way you live in your life, the work you do.
All of those things come in and start in a place and in my case come in and start in my family, West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next is this was the best day of my life."
A: how does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird things, I like weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> for what does that matter?
What is the <unk> What phase of <unk> you meet here?
Why is it important? What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more than you are.
What's other <unk>
I don't have to be afraid what kind of rollercoaster is you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)  Thank you.)
A: thank you for your patience. Great <unk> A: yes. <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot of madness in all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of it, but <unk> on your <unk> personality <unk>
They were getting very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are just going to be focused on one of their strong strengths or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to be, and it's nature's nature to avoid the things that they're not <unk> to avoid fear, those elements, and you actually make them <unk> and make them become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are playful marks and brands -- those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is pretty powerful.
MS:
If someone asks you to give you your brand your brand, your brand, your brand, which would be?
You're a <unk> attribute -- you are somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you rather a <unk> attribute of it.
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful to be fresh as <unk> contemporary or bold or bold or bold as <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Or are you rather <unk>
Are you conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're a traditional model: traditional <unk> <unk> you with <unk>
You're a <unk> stable, familiar, safe, safe, <unk> <unk> like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this movie we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who were saying, they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control, they wouldn't have control over the end product.
We were allowed to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how they now use MRI to identify the centers of the desire in the brain as much commercial marketing as a movie film.
Went to San Paulo where we have banned advertising to the outdoor air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there is no <unk> nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are getting their way into the schools with money problems in America.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects I have had the greatest response or the ones that I've been most successful is those in which I interact with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They took the <unk> out of their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with an artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about people who are going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? They succeed?
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This shows just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just <unk> no press, no TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad because most of the agencies that we talked to him <unk> to their customers won't be part.
I've always believed that if you take yourself if you take risks, that on those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get out to the people of that are pushing the failure.
I think when you train their employees at loss <unk> at risk is preparing their own company to reward you from rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to have no fear of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we need to give him the fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to support transparency.
More than ever a bit of honesty is going to run a long way.
And that said that, with honesty and transparency, all my talk, <unk> <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who were <unk> the rights for the name of <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data on big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presented with <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, <unk> in the name of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check on behalf of the TED organization, the Foundation, Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my TED for TED year.
The idea behind the Gordian worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software are completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a cash virus from Windows in a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enter the gray box to the gray box hurts the <unk> and the nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, yeah?
I want to tell you how we found this.
When we started researching <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> of <unk> the multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed like to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
That struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they went very strange.
<unk> <unk> as a laboratory rat didn't like our <unk> that wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And then to experiment with different cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for active in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it's effectively working in that place.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because <unk> We don't know what the <unk> is.
Could it be, let's say, for example, a power plant plant or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than you will do it soon.
So we pulled out and spread the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> bombs -- a small one and a big.
We also saw that they were armed with very professionally people who obviously had all the internal information.
I would take all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you the burden is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here's a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines of code.
It's pretty much like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking at initially called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
We then were looking for <unk> and data structures and trying to address it, with the real world, with potential goals of the real world.
We need about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about targets we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> valuable, and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most infections have been <unk>
They don't find several thousand goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I called them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that part cell inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in one obvious effort to go crazy to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> by looking at the data and their structures.
So, for example, the number <unk> comes up in that code, you can't afford it.
I started researching scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That had a coincidence.
And it got better.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in my hands.
So it's not like this.
The results have been transmitted after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
And yet, we discovered that those two digital men would have thought to one single goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating it.
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We don't need to worry about other targets to be <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some really interesting things that we saw -- really <unk>
There's the grey box and the top you see the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the values of input for example, of the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and provides <unk> code, which is still running during the attack, with a false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security chamber feeds on <unk> video.
It's nice <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only <unk> the operators in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the large steam turbine goes on, you have to open valves <unk>
Obviously, this can't make a human operator of it.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when you're <unk> then they can pass bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> not the security system <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a power plant, or at a automobile factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have any <unk> <unk> to disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms.
<unk> as possible.
And if you made that, with what we <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces in a lot of targets.
We have to face the implications, and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that the <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower engine.
There is one alone, and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because, otherwise our problems would be older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take a robot and give them <unk> or another one that will make user chairs up and go back and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
It's not different than something you put in the morning, it gives you a great force, which is in addition to your speed, and it helps you for example, to drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect them to the universe and with other <unk> things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back -- a <unk> load of pounds, and it's being allowed to lead even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on your back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage to the back.
We decided to consider this challenge and create a exoskeleton that I could help to drive the whole thing.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can <unk> 90 pounds of land in a lot of hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running with great <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where do I want to go, and then raise my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner, to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back and go back to the users of wheelchair, which I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people who, in the wheels, all around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very young people, young people with damage to the column that their lives -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide in a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only option.
We also talk about the population that's <unk> quickly.
Their only option, lots of times -- because of a brain injury or another complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been so for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter on mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who did 19 years ago had an injury in the neocortical column, and as a result, couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's about sensors -- has a few sensors.
It was completely not <unk> on the crutches who sends signals on board, here on the back.
There are also about batteries that give the power to the motors in the <unk> and in the knees, and they do it forward to this very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, because of a strange jump in the air, skiing down it was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all of it and all the motion from <unk>
Shortly after a doctor, a doctor walked into my room at the hospital, and he said to me, <unk> will never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So stole me to the last hint of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs up in <unk> climbing rocks and even set up a bicycle <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change future generations -- not just from soldiers, but Amanda, and to all the users of <unk> everybody.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hi, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man festival. or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet their cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos in the forests of Congo.
The bonobos are along with chimpanzees, their closest relatives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much focused on this aspect of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by large, <unk> the Bonobo Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a rather tolerant society where the death violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest <unk> and it has been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> an land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the violent conflict scenario that has been sustained for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put the survival of the Bonobo.
The trade of meat and deforestation is made that you can't fill in nor a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos can be heard hidden <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the democratic apes -- love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> as humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a children's game.
For us and the game is fundamental to establish links and foster <unk>
With him learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo Bonobo you see the roots, the same ones of laughter, the dance and the human ritual,
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos taken from the wild medium.
First, it's a <unk> ball game, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what she is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk>
I just think in this case, he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So the sex game is common in bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing involved elements -- like <unk> and also how game requires and <unk> and at the same time it's more fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to look at this is <unk> a young female who is playing with <unk> water.
I think, as her, sometimes we play ourselves, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more and more difficult world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these abilities.
In other words, play is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's make sure the maximum our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems at least appropriate play, they can be the moments where it's more <unk>
So they were able to primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and play together while <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I am responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I am not fighting poverty, they were <unk> fires as a captain of captain in a <unk> <unk> body.
And in our city, where volunteers escaped to a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the fire site very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a fairly high probability of going.
But there was still a racing race against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our job was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that we certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were standing at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and she was in his pajamas and his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just arrived before I was like, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- he came back to the captain and he asked him to go back and would save the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> of money who, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people that I walked into a little building in flames to save a live alive just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need you to go home.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a pair of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I was waiting for, but I got up the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went through the firemen to <unk> that at that height of the <unk> and I went into the fourth one in search of a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the precious dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house, the treasures of the house where, as a expected, his trove got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the house, <unk> by the brave effort in order to save his house.
The kindness that she watched on the other was that someone had had even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as a firefighter of volunteering and I'm a witness of acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of acts of grace and courage on the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So, when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or you're at <unk> levels of success I'd like to remind you this: not wait.
You don't wait for the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you get right now.
They were eating food in a dining room, a city park.
Are you mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody's life, but every day we will influence somebody's life.
So you enter the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules of a fixed measurement that fits each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings, or bridges, a brick at the same time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> it came up with this.
He called her <unk>
And in a few years, the building blocks came to all the homes.
It's been estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 million blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the concrete, block in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, at the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete, block the transistor allows to create much greater and more complex circuits at the same time.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't think that the building blocks of our time are becoming an <unk> so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of taking the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they come together by retirement.
So you can't put it in the wrong way.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, the pink is the entrance and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with green and very quickly you can start to make higher circuits.
A blue with one green is making light.
We can put a button in the middle and have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse, which is here, and now we have a light <unk>
We put this <unk> to create more impact and we have a computer machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having that program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make <unk> faster or slower -- just <unk> this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection growing.
We want all the interactions in the world to get into building ready to use.
<unk> sound, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics for every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light of night, or why the door of an elevator elevator is open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So, for example, designers without any experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers of the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, which has no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, and paper and told them, Do something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, an overdose of <unk> moving around.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> who is afraid of darkness.
For these no engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be in the scope of all.
So, <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, you download all the files of design and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world, is ours.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you.
Today I'm going to tell you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar industry.
And my little firm is to get involved with the environment focusing on the environment.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a small video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology.
Oh, I mean, I know the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we're supposed to do, we asked them to work in the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and would be like <unk> Peace <unk>
<unk> a few members every year and put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of taking the Third World we send them into the wild world.
They made big <unk> worked with employees <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a hydrant in Boston.
Here it comes as if I took a date, but what really looks for is that someone will clean up when you get caught by snow because he knows it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get to ask for help in this way <unk>
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time, I was very much about last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that the citizens of the citizens <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice app that you can take on a <unk>
Do you accept <unk> when you were <unk>
In doing so, you put a name, in this case, put it up <unk>
If you don't.
So it has a players' component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications -- last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
It spreads viral.
A system of systems in the city of <unk> when you see this app realized that I could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to make them <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> <unk> but people steals the batteries.
That's why they ask citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizen citizens <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just got <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they were born.
So now we know about nine cities that are using using using it.
And this has spread out of <unk> naturally and natural way.
If you know a little government technology, you know that this doesn't happen.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then we told us that I had done by the normal channels it would have taken at least two million and a half million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the California judicial power, so far two million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every single government.
So an app that would program in a couple of days and it spreads in viral form is a kind of <unk> shot to the institution of government.
It suggests the best ways to work, not as in private companies, like a lot of people think that it should be.
Neither as a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in an open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution of an institution, but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we can connect together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country who are contributing to applications in their own communities.
They haven't given up to the government.
You have a great frustration that's before but they don't get rid of it.
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And that is that if we left the feelings of the politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that make us crazy, the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because it alone doesn't exist.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately made up of -- remember that from <unk> the way to think about it will affect how to make change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to choose <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, mostly about <unk>
This is the health care center and information center.
It's the place that calls calls if you brand <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> This phone call.
He started <unk> at the basis of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put music right and see if you <unk>
And it worked.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston has no call center.
It has a <unk> and mobile website, called <unk> <unk>
I didn't make that app.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this really comes this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
The dynamics of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking to person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
The next report, like, "I come to the place, I found the cube of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical physics.
And it's also a great example of the government income in a distributed governance collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition technology of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get together and help others.
So, one citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
connected to two people.
And it could be connected to the government services to be needed but neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than the government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, <unk> communities.
If we call control control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but they think that one is the input of the other.
That our entry into the government system is the <unk>
How many times have you picked up a political <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will destroy our values and make our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface of a blank <unk>
So below what we call <unk>
And we say that word <unk>
But it's that <unk> which holds us that that belongs to us that we financed as something that operates against us, that else, and in consequence we are losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make that bureaucracy as sexy.
Because that's where the real job of government.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They've been <unk>
It's a group of citizens worried that they've written a very detailed report from 325 pages in response to the request of <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for those of us that we've been faced with the government, is time we ask ourselves what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't leave with government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and he knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> you only articulate systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am a generation of older than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who are going to <unk> everyone will talk.
They can express their opinions at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem you don't care about making your voices.
They're using your hands.
They lay up the work to program applications that make applications work better to government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking away <unk> <unk> a garbage cube which has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are as a digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay and we get services.
We are more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone here, when it comes to the important things we have to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or also going to be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most despair. I've spent most despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here are impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have a different way.
I say this because I think identity is important <unk>
Here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the law, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a family <unk> dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was tough, it was strong, had power.
It was the last word in the whole discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Their parents were born in slavery in Virginia on <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way they saw the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and I looked at it, she was approaching me and I gave me a good hug.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then let me go.
One or two hours later, I would come back to me, and I said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I <unk> again and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this quality of human quality that would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is I had 10 children.
My mother was the lower 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to take his time and their attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I woke up in the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At the beginning I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at her and <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up through the room, she took me out of the hand, and he said, "Come on, <unk> <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you <unk>
I said, "Okay, let's <unk>
She said, "Now I don't read it. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he looked at me, and he said, "I want you to know I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "I don't want you to give me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to think about is that we always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second one I want you to tell me, is that you will always do the right thing, even though the right thing is it <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk>
Then he finally said, "Hey, third thing I want you to think about is that I never want to be <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk>
I grew up in the field, in rural rural. I have a brother a year older and a younger year.
When I was 14, 15, one day my brother came home with a package of six <unk> I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and I went to the forest.
We just got the <unk> of the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, she gave my sister, she took a little bit and offered me.
I said, "No, no, no. You get me wrong, but I'm not going to take you <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today -- and you always do the same thing that we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No, I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's up? Take a <unk>
I went on the look at the force and <unk> "Oh, you won't be thinking of the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells you all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this to be a <unk> I say that by the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to the other they really don't see it.
We can't get to do things that don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother thought that all their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to her, we should have <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There's 2.3 million now.
In America, we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive incarceration in my opinion, has changed our world.
In poor communities, or black, you find so much <unk> as much despair.
One in three black people in the age of 18 and 30 years is in prison or in parole.
In urban <unk> around the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore -- 50 to 60 percent of all young people in the prison are in jail or in parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system which is much better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> it's wealth and wealth that affects the results.
And it looks like we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger makes us believe that these aren't problems with us.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work in some good developments curious.
In my state in Alabama, as well as in the other state of other states, you have to have an rights <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black population has lost definitely the right as a <unk>
And if we projected it over the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights to be as high as it was before you were <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where it sentence in 13 years to die in prison.
We have this country jail for children, no chance to go out ever.
Right now we are in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
People in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
And in some sense we've been <unk> to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by crimes <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by error.
Out of nine people <unk> has identified one who is innocent and liberated from the death row.
A rate of mistake, <unk> an innocent in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would be not allowed to fly airplanes if every nine to you would have to be <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students in college history, I talk about slavery talking about slavery today.
I'm talking about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted to the Second World War.
We really don't know much about this.
But for black Americans in this country, was a very time defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you suggest talks, <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our evolutionary history -- for the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No, <unk> that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was obviously with segregation and decades of racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood what we've historically done before.
All of the time we have to do with each other.
We constantly created tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they could not overcome <unk> and without compromise with the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving lectures about death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's pretty disturbing to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> We don't have death penalty in Germany.
<unk> we never can have it here."
The room was silent and a lady said, "There's no way that we have our story, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, and <unk> and <unk> were going to be <unk>
<unk> about this.
How would we feel that in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We wouldn't have it <unk>
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these issues, the positive and wonderful things they are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology -- <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the abuse, the <unk> <unk>
In my view, it is necessary to integrate these things.
lately lately we talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more <unk> with the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who never come to TED.
Think about them is, in a way, something that's inside of us.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to the intellectual thing.
And with innovation, the development comes not just from brain ideas.
These things come from ideas -- also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the difficult.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is virtually in the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There is no disconnect with technology and design that allows us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to make sure that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer from meeting <unk> <unk>
These women were gathered just to talk about.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> was called to say, <unk> comes the <unk> lady <unk> We are going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and get it.
I said, "Yes, lady. I do."
So she said, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read him <unk>
So I was going and just the <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks went to me and said, "Now, please tell me that it's that idea of <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end the sentences of life, without freedom.
We try to do something about death penalty
We try to reduce population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave my whole best speech and he looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that time, Mrs. <unk> got my finger <unk> and said, "It's why you have to be very much but very <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher than the worst we've ever met.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone is taking something that doesn't belong to, it's not that it's a <unk>
Even if somebody kills another, it's not a <unk>
So this is why I think there's a basic dignity in the people who should be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's what it is.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very exciting -- we're not going to judge us by our technology, because of our designs, or our intellectual capacity or rational.
By the end of the character of a society, not by the way they treat the rich powerful and powerful, but the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these kids who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients in 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> for them as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can this be?
How can a judge a judge convert someone in what isn't it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a kid.
A very late night was awake <unk> by God, if the judge can turn it into something you don't are, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was there, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14 year-old customer -- a tiny, black <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my 14 year-old black client to be treated as a <unk> privileged <unk> of a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there there were some <unk> behavior in the <unk> behavior in the middle of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical <unk> but all the lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really the <unk>
For my horror, not only <unk> it was sent to court.
About two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court for this case stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went into the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got out of the car. She walks to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found a black man <unk> it was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's <unk> I said yes.
And then I came up and approached me.
And I was overwhelmed by the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
It connected deeply with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a sense of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
When I walked in, the judge saw me saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, -- you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> and I started walking.
People started to go. They were all <unk>
I was the ones that had written those <unk>
They got the policemen the prosecutors the prosecutors the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people -- all right, because we talked about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I hit the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I would look through the window and let me hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black black, with a head of concern, I entered the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge was <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> assistant showed because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant across the old black black.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> hall.
And the old black stood up, looked at the <unk> he looked at me and said, <unk> to this young audience to tell this young woman to keep his view in the objective of <unk>
I've come to TED today because I think that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds towards justice.
We cannot be truly human beings, if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to others.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of you here who share this, I just want to tell you to keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something that isn't a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you will make an effort to make the funds that are being spent on this current policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death penalty over the next five years. One billion dollars.
And despite the case of this, the <unk> of the homicide cases not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> don't get to nothing.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to be able to get the law to make the law, for safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say that what you think is this?
<unk> Actually, the <unk> rate has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's for the wrong war on drugs.
That's why this dramatic increases in the population of <unk>
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into the supply chain for stealing a bicycle, for small crime crimes against the property, rather than making <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've been excited about here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for coming to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> the threats by Bin Laden's death.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months <unk> could be over the last six days or over the last six years.
The idea is that media media would prefer to <unk> negative news, because our minds are paying attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every single day our senses is getting a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And like nothing else to survive, the first stop on all of those data is an ancient piece of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector -- the danger.
<unk> and recorded all the information looking for something in the environment that could hurt us.
So from a <unk> of stories, we would look at the negative.
That old saying of the <unk> "If there is blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us the negative news, the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, no wonder we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world will go wrong in worse.
But maybe it isn't.
Maybe, in change, what really happens is we received <unk>
Perhaps today's progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems, climate change, the <unk> of water and <unk> we certainly have them.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and, in the long time, we just had them.
<unk> then happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average income per capita platforms has <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has shrunk to 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy has gone from 25 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to <unk> <unk> expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, roads, <unk> television, mobile and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the past century, the <unk> of the planet, would have ever dreamed of with such <unk>
We have a lot of this technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we had on information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to notice two things on this curve.
First, how soft it is -- in good and bad days, in war and peace, in depression and on the rise.
It's the result of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before none of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> in a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And on this curve, to Moore's Law -- there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
<unk> in the cloud, which my friends of <unk> call infinite computers, sensors and networks, the actual printing and their ability to democratize and to distribute personalized production on all of the planet -- synthetic biology, the fuels and the food, the digital biology, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
He plays the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available to every cell phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach them these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, that can impact the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating plenty, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each other, it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that it's scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that frees resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon ate with <unk> of silver, and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on planet, it was worth the gold and the <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington Washington is from aluminum <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal.
It's tied to oxygen and <unk>
But then he came the <unk> and he made aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
We have this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a <unk> planet for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk>
It's not about anger, it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study showing that in the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we have a abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed at the Voyager space to the Earth, in 1990, after I passed it on.
You put a famous photo, how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought by the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there's a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you with you, gave me permission to get your technology called <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small refrigerator long.
It's capable of generating a thousand liters of drinking water on a day of any source water, saltwater, water -- <unk> by less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coke just thought I'm going to make a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that this will be, Coke in the world in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an evolutionary innovation for this technology that is today.
And we've seen it on mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that mighty warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than the Reagan president, 25 years ago.
And to have a smart mobile phone with Google, has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have happened.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video and libraries of books and music, technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to get when the health applications come in.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies in a mobile device that they talk to us, and because it has <unk> you can be able to get blood from the finger.
To win has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of the health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that we don't want to call the <unk> and the first place, prevent the pandemic happening.
But this is the greatest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the billion on the rise.
The white lines here are the population.
We've just got the brand of the <unk>
By the way, the best protection against the demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, let's move from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never had to make it up to the global conversation.
What will these people?
What are you going to do? What wishes to <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse we will have the largest economic injection in history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And more health care thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D impressions and the computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give up three billion members of humanity, healthy and <unk> and <unk>
How about a voices never before <unk>
What if we give them the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and power for the first time?
What do you do? These three billion dollars?
And if you're contributions we can't afford it.
Something that I learned with the X Prize, is that small, guided equipment, guided by their passion with an objective goal, they can do things that were things that were previously able to do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this college university university at each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined up and started to <unk>
And it has shown that the recognition machinery of human patterns is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge amount of confidence in the future is that we have more power to take on the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the <unk> <unk> passion.
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion minds, we have been transferred to work on the solution of the big challenges and to do what we should do.
We have for a few decades of extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they think that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
It was caught up to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk> Red <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they keep <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned so much with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from some <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20, the black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so I was getting over the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had fallen down in half.
I went to the five centimeters.
You have genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of the <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> in the <unk> Europe made a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was to impose to the countries that were already 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this kind of ugly, kind of ugly, thing called the <unk> 4.
I went out to fish in him, and we did studies in the south of the Ross Sea <unk> and above all, in the Beaufort Sea.
What we built was something <unk>
<unk> now yes, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are at the bottom.
And most of the fish are the tiny blobs of the fish are <unk> tiny about <unk> remains of coral reefs.
In short, the sea bottom came to the cover and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishing.
The background happens to be a solid coral background, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
They don't <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen collect every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But there's no <unk>
They took the world, but we don't remember.
<unk> the starting point, the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, number of <unk> <unk> in the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time, changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation to use images in the beginning of their conscious life as the normal and they extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
They don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the accumulation of changes.
And at the end of the end of the <unk> <unk>
And that, in great measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that don't are, or not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when poor societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very prevalent before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animal animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this isn't perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and on a sea synonymous with large fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time there are just a few fish, but we think that's the starting point.
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence introduced in an earlier way, is not the way they would expect to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of them <unk> like that that Captain and so I looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or, usually they don't use the scientists of the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't trust the sources of the past.
Out of the enormous role that can come into a protected marine area.
Because with marine protected areas, we really recreated the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive because the starting point has been running and is extremely low.
That's for the people who can see a protected marine area and they can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they have no access, as the people in the Midwest, for example?
I think the arts and film may fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the <unk> Bay simulation of <unk>
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about what people were very touched with the movie <unk> talking about the story of <unk> why they were <unk> with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one I giving, is to Cameron, to do <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube YouTube video.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why the videos are <unk> and what importance has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But today video video does that any of us, or our actions, copper notoriety in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be done famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They go up over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, just a small percentage is viral gets lots and lots and lots of cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, communities of involvement and surprise.
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
KT: Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot out of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the rise in the rise of popularity last summer.
I was not saying to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that <unk> the video to the popular.
<unk> of trends like Jimmy <unk> are presented with new things and interesting and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  This is Friday, Friday. You have to start on Friday.   Everybody wants to get the weekend out of week --                                    Let's not think we could have this conversation without talking
<unk> of Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have emerged from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> who's one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of creators can embrace a point of view, and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this big internal joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment entertainment of the 20th century, this community engagement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an undercover animation with a musical music.
So that's it.
This year, you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that is rare, you know there is a three million dollars that has been seen four million times.
And until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats watching the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made a version of the old one.
And then it's taken up.
All of a sudden, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> or <unk> or Black Rebecca or <unk> <unk>
What script might have been written by <unk> this situation?
In a world where you go up two days of video per minute, just the only single and unexpected thing can tell you, the way these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't get too much interested in it.
Casey <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent themselves properly from <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise effect, and their humor, Casey <unk> had gotten five million to see and understand their idea.
So this approach is true for all the new things that we do in <unk>
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> communities of engagement, which are totally unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media -- that we all have access to and is the audience that defines the popularity of it.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, <unk> <unk> started on YouTube.
You wouldn't get permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, it's just the ones that are today, but <unk> entertainment in the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the single hope and freedom of their country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so much time, friends, now I <unk>
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that history tried to <unk> but I was doing it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> towards the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girls.
For her, life had been meant to a <unk> task of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> that defies fiction, a boat turned into the sea of the <unk> <unk>
All adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the pirate rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk>
If we were <unk> first of my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the motor, the <unk> will diving into each wave, and the vast vast and vacuum.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they got <unk> with the bravery of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to pluck for six hours.
But I do remember the lights from the oil platform in front of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, and I finish the journey was too much to it; and the first apple I tried, given by the men on the platform.
No apple had once had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of class <unk> whose population is made of immigrants together.
Unlike the middle suburbs of the middle class -- which I was in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the <unk> English fragments -- among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days double <unk>
And yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT <unk> of <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and that was established an extra mentoring in English and math, wouldn't mind what was supposed to be <unk> which was usually <unk> <unk>
Two pairs of middle pairs for school, one to hide holes from the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk>
home.
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I would get in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we got away on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother suffered <unk> every single boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares are in order to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women were coming with their stories about men who couldn't make the angry transition and <unk> and <unk> boys caught between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And it was created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic classical student, relentless with what I suffer from myself.
On the other hand, he was <unk> in life <unk> tragically <unk> by violence, abuse of drugs and isolation.
But many received aid over the years.
And for that work, when I studied my last year from lawyer by a last year from lawyer who picked me the young Australian young year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges don't exist.
As a <unk> resident anonymously in <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and activist activist invited to talk about sites that had never been <unk> and in houses whose existence would never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retire into the routines. and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother, a mother and two daughters ending up the day as they did for nearly 20 years, <unk> on the day of every single bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I was now the same age that she had when she went on the ship.
He hadn't ever been an option.
<unk> said to me, "and don't be what you don't like.
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly I talked about, the more it was <unk> to talk about.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what they were doing -- living on the border of possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk> career.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a unknown, a <unk> new at the scene -- and not only it's good, but it's something that was grateful, maybe a ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, I know, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They didn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was an energy there, which was an amazing mixture of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
So I went to a small group of people for the people who <unk> <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I made a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
It was going to be all the way down to the evening.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant ones and we opened up.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
First of all, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of her husband, he caused a <unk> to <unk> and take the cause her itself, and a lot more <unk> caused when I won it.
The can't be done by proven to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in a hotel room, when she was born 1,000 miles in <unk>
And I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it stop on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, I went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories and we made sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is her hand hot and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"Not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since those of us who were and how life is built us now -- we can now see that the men that would have come to our lives would have been <unk>
<unk> would have very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could that wish for you?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy for the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your life, a brave <unk> in every wave, the constant pace of the engine, the vast horizon that is not guaranteed at all?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to a secure and see it -- I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is now here in the fourth or a fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the Arab sky with the singer, <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indian Indians wanted to travel to a car and put the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
And at that time when you <unk> the Great Indian warrior Indian, it was <unk> it took a bow and with a <unk> to the floor, he could get water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that struck me so much.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I was telling you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to be able to allow the magic, not <unk>
As a girl my grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this piece for 50 years was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones and the camera clocks and the cameras prevent them from <unk>
We have our inspiration.
That's why I was <unk> I came up to this technological world to see how it can use to create magic, instead of <unk>
I had books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a device of storytelling able to connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where are we where we are.
I put the text with the image and captured sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do we do with that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive application for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so --  -- he says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In many moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live because of GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl is excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean wizards and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, those ideas that we teach from children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar have always turned to me and exciting.
So here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And actually, they shine your way into the rest of the book.
Another idea that was fascinated by a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In all of you fantasy -- there's always been maps but been static maps.
This is a map that goes up, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important thing for me is to create Indian content and contemporary and contemporary
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old old book.
So we're bringing them back in a children's story.
In a story that deals with present issues like environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they have not come to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure where you have to go outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a little girl I had a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids are no longer doing it.
So to reclaim this childhood ritual you have to go out and in a chapter, and a picture of a flower and then <unk>
Another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So you create a digital collection of pictures that can then be put on the Web.
A child in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Inside of the variations of connection between magic, Earth and technology are so many possibilities.
In the next book, we asked to have an interaction in which you go out with the iPad and the video on and through augmented reality sees a group of <unk> that shows about the inner plants of the house.
The screen is full of leaves on the screen.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are correlated with technology and magic and technology comes to each other.
Let's take the power of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sat down with a simple story.
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University University was <unk> to a listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, family and <unk> What do you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems that all of us, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> fail because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale -- it's very simple.
It has a <unk> <unk>
Every morning I was hooked.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge of getting to 95 percent.
But it is so simple, that every time I would give you my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor from <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time when she needs <unk> or any urgency of that style -- but I saw it backwards.
But there's something else.
As some of you know, I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect myself to my Wi-Fi scale and before I climb up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> today I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the used pairs to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can <unk> to move people from their chairs together and develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the week next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people would run from their homes, take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, come back to recover the control and become captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us health care because of the challenges we face, like the firing cost of attention, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
It was techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share with you with a video.
We all have any controls of navigation in <unk>
Maybe we even have our phones.
We know perfectly where ATMs are ATMs in <unk>
Now, where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food chain.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
So what we did was they do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked them to the public <unk> they see a <unk> please <unk> <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes they open up in <unk> and other are closed.
And more than 10,000 <unk> were already presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an application for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> they can use their iPhone, and the next weeks to use their cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I would like to present this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but as a <unk>
And we wish we had globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody else, can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
They could be <unk> or <unk> people, for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in their place.
Please focus on this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, these are pictures that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was awakened with my first digital camera at the age of 15 years.
It mixed with my recent passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because when I use the camera this process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to be in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that starts by pressing the <unk>
<unk> like this is this: a construction on a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful and colorful at the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can <unk> but I always want it to be captured in some way like photography.
I think you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to be capturing an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it happen.
Is it the details or the <unk>
We would have light?
What do we create <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end of it it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are really simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
So here we have three perfectly <unk> things that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some way can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if they exist.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So, <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a photo look like it looks realistic I think they're those ones that don't even give us the things around our daily lives.
But by combining pictures it's very important to <unk> because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will follow to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures <unk> must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> were taken out of the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect experience.
It has to be impossible to see where the image is <unk>
Here's another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the lower part is <unk>
But this picture is totally comprised of photographs of different places.
In the personal I think it's easier to create a place that you find out because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that have in the head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to find out to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone <unk>
And yes, I even made a red house on the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to get an realistic outcome I think we need planning.
You always start with an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take pictures the result can be very beautiful, and at the very realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody who took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details but the general side.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, like a lot of others that we usually see, is kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves that are novelty.
Here's a weird thing.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please switch the lights.
They're more intensity because they write about paper.
Why do we draw technological curves at <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them on a regular curve in which, say, these are the years or some time unit -- and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to give you the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you will, for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a curved curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of shipping is going to be as fast as <unk> past tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't move to that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of technological development that every few years are on orders of magnitude.
The question I want to ask is -- looking at these <unk> curves, we see that they don't follow forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
I would take one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical curve like this until it comes to something completely different, or maybe it will do something like this.
That's all you can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what it used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask is, and ask me, is: What is that new way you <unk> the world?
So what new state is going around the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
That happens a transformation, we can feel it.
And we know it doesn't make sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything is so different than extrapolate what we're doing today does not make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how that transition could be that <unk>
But to do that, I'll have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at long-term things.
The scale of time I would like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So you go back about two billion years when the Earth was a big rock rock with a lot of chemicals that will spread around them.
If we look at the way that those chemicals were organized by a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that is that, at that time, there were about <unk> oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those blobs of oil held a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside the outside and the droplets grew up growing up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the <unk> cell forms -- those oil <unk>
But those droplets were not alive, in the current sense, because each of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time you get <unk> you would have a distributed distribution of the chemicals that we make.
So every single <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, the droplets that somehow are getting better at time to incorporate chemical chemicals together, more chemicals -- more chemicals and <unk> more.
Mostly they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, a very simple way, but things are interesting when these droplets learned the trick.
Somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this meaningless evolution, a system of writing that allowed them to record what they were to be able to pick up what they were to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that visual system seems to be stable in since evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living thing is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things that I did only for <unk> We can also write things with this code.
Here I have a hundred white dust that try to hide to the security security.
But <unk> Tom this <unk> the code has the common letters that we used to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to the 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of them for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus, and it would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy, another billion years ago.
But then another big step happened in which things were very different, and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming information forming the cells.
I don't know if you know it, but the bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, we have evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found a way of avoiding penicillin and <unk> to create their small DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resilient to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication took place to form communities that, in a way, they were together in that way, and a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point happened when these communities were very close to that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe in the community of DNA in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities that have communities, communities of many different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have many cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started to <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't make information in the community.
It's the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the tools to process the information that those communities built built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the <unk> structures to understand and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time of evolutionary time.
So one organism could, for example, learn not to eat some fruit because he knew bad and got sick the last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of a organism because they had built these information processing structures that through evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals who ate their fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built these information structures really accelerated to the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time we need to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the communication.
So, for example, the most <unk> version of it is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a <unk> idea.
I'm sitting here emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in their heads that saved some analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated -- we turn it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start working as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing <unk>
We now go through periods of periods of <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> and so on.
And that brings us together into something much larger and faster than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> in which we made some evolution with the <unk> program to our eyes.
And now we've accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of history that told them led a billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
<unk> and so on, took less than a million years.
And the following, as electronics, it seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that speeds up its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that job for <unk> would not be possible without the recent computers.
But now design objects of such complexity, which would be impossible for me to do it differently.
I don't know that every transistor on that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think of a level of abstraction we put it into the machine and the machine with that does something that before you don't can, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes uses methods that we don't even understand.
A particularly interesting method I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates at the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please <unk> you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, to run all those programs, and take those things that we want to do what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to tell you numbers, to put a simple example.
So what we find is the programs that are more close to numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that a few random random sequences.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, "You could take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the <unk>
They were going to take those and get them to the rest.
And now we <unk> the best numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to the <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the children will transcend the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs that were made of the combinations of programs that had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
<unk> again.
It would take some mutations in it.
And he tries to talk about it and do it with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complex cases in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are perfect <unk>
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze it to see how they work.
They're dark programs.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security of the safety of the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that were able to do it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
I was once on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he takes a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> aircraft has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to provide a <unk> flight, don't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become messy.
So we started to rely on computers to make a different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the choices that are.
It goes in front of us.
We now use those programs to make computers much faster and so able to run these programs much faster.
And so it is <unk>
The thing gets faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms.
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the heck we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to our thinking that we are the end product of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of whatever it is.
But now comes the lunch and I think stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give you a part of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end of the <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of <unk> <unk> talks about statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you have heard of.
It's called average <unk>
And we talk about 300, from a <unk> that I voted 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of game without being <unk> and that anybody who deals with the first base, it doesn't get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know what they call a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody who is 10 <unk> it gets to get four.
<unk> like the top Ted Williams, the last player at the League <unk> of <unk> in running more strokes in a regular season.
Now I'm going to do this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they have a surgeon who has also a <unk> record in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place, and a dear has two arteries <unk> and your family doctor gets it to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting better at this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask:
What do you think should be the average of hits of a heart surgeon, or a nurse from a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, great.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, from a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, though, is sending them the world, and they included me with the mandate to be perfect.
You'd never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the take-home message when I was in medical school.
I was an obsessional student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Sachs would be studied to a blood exam.
Just like that.
<unk> in my small <unk> in the <unk> of the General <unk> Hospital not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
Out of my fellow <unk> <unk> the origin and the <unk> the branching in every single artery that comes out of the <unk> <unk> diagnosis and <unk>
And I even knew <unk> diagnosis about how to classify <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was really fine. I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> of medical school with the impression that if you were going to take everything, then would you know everything, or the most possible thing to all of all, because I would get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady to the emergency room where I worked.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency emergency emergency room would I have to go to a cardiologist to get to the patient right.
I report to the chief of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a sound <unk>
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which was a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to your lungs, these are <unk> and so there is a hard to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I was going to give him.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate pressure on their heart.
I gave him <unk> water pills so that it could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I felt pretty good.
And there it was when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more errors.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get up the phone and I did what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident who has constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even seeing my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send it to your house, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inner one that said, <unk> is not a good idea.
In fact, I was so insecure that I even asked the nurse to <unk> the lady <unk> "Do you think it's okay if you go to her <unk>
And the nurse thought and then said <unk> "Yes, I think I'm okay.
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed the high school, and the ambulance with the ambulance was brought her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I would try to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was going to go home. So I did something that I don't usually do normally, I did something that I don't know.
I went through the emergency room on the emergency table.
And there is another nurse, not the one that I would say from the lady <unk> before, but the other three words, those three words that most emergency emergency doctors.
Other specialists are also afraid of it, but there is a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see patients <unk>
The three words are: it remembers you?
Whatever the patient sent to his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
"Well, she <unk> it with the same voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
Within an hour that I got to his house, after I gave her a high school, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance guys brought it into the emergency room with a blood pressure of <unk> which means a shock <unk>
I just barely breathed and it was blue.
The emergency personnel <unk> all their resources.
They gave him medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care, and I expected them against all hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days after the next two days it was obvious that I never did.
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family went together together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And in ninth day, they let her go. Mrs. <unk> wife, <unk>
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks later, I was excited about it, and I experienced for the first time the shame is there in our medical culture, and I felt by <unk> <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't afford it with your colleagues.
You make peace and never more make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> <unk> that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that meant that.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure they were making sure I did the stuff and he made sure that I didn't care about.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did I send him home?
And my worst <unk> Why did I made a mistake that <unk>
Why did I chose medicine?
Shortly that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And on one day <unk> opened the sky and finally came the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if you were going to take the efforts to be perfect for not to make more mistakes, I would stop those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was an assistant, in the emergency department in a community hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked up, because I was a little bit <unk>
He took him out of penicillin and sent him to her home.
But while he ran to the door kept pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my <unk> change my boss asked me to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he gave the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not because of the top, but you can take the closing out of those tracks.
He, did not die.
They were <unk> antibiotics by it <unk> and they <unk>
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were getting 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't go home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
He took an X-ray X-ray but it turned out, a colleague who was checking the patient -- some sensitivity at the lower right quadrant, and I called a surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague who <unk>
I checked it and when I noticed some sensitivity in the lower right, I called a surgeon.
Both were operated on and they recovered well.
But every single case I would love with myself is <unk>
But I would like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most significant people have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and without support.
And here's the problem: if I can't get a lot of my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what's really going on, how to share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this to not make the same <unk>
If I could go now to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear somebody talk about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, as a <unk> in my hospital in my hospital -- the wrong leg -- belief that I would have a hard time on to look at your eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and those who can't sleep and the ones that may not sleep and the ones that I know; they have <unk> outcomes and the ones that have great outcomes.
And it's almost like an antibody reaction that you start to attack that person.
So we have the idea that if we take out of medicine to the people who make mistakes, will be a safe system.
But that brings up two problems.
In 20 years about diffusion and journalism, I have done a personal study of bad medical litigation and errors to learn how we can, from the first article that I wrote to the Star Trek article that I wrote to the Star Trek <unk> Black <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where errors happen every day, where one in 10 drugs in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where the bacterial infections are more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, there are <unk> <unk> by <unk> medical errors.
The Institute of Medicine, established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we are not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so these are things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is going on every two or three years, and we don't care about it.
<unk> sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with pain in your chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain -- come up with eyes <unk> and with breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story is <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't have their symptoms always in the same way.
For all of this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we <unk> and we eliminate all the professional professionals -- you know, you won't get any one.
And with respect to people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> white, <unk> art, it's already a habit to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say everyone from the <unk> to the chief of surgery -- "This is my worst <unk> blah blah -- "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students are <unk> they will slow down your head and drop saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> to be able to say, "Look, they didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The medical doctor is human <unk> you know, they accept it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They have their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
We have the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and the support for everybody to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes over time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I am human.
And I feel so much, but I strive to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I memory.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day.
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
Recently, I made a survey more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says to pick an American American, are about 70 to a day.
Not a lot, in a research went through a week to a group of chairs of business.
The researchers recorded the different tasks that are driven by these executives and time that we are trying to make things related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> <unk> jobs.
Naturally, every work included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of her time.
Now think of your elections.
You know how many belong to the <unk> category, and how many of an hour?
How do I grade the way that they're driving those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to the <unk> of choices.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
In other ways, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this very, very <unk> supermarket at least at least at that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
There was 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 water <unk> and this was when we took water <unk>
I loved going to that shop, but I was asked, why I never buy nothing?
This is a shelf from the oil <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in <unk> box that came from trees to come from trees.
I once decided to go to the manager of the manager and asked him, "Do you have this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed to the buses full of tourists who came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of different classes.
He took a set of <unk> right to the entrance to the store.
We put it up there <unk> from six <unk> or 24 flavors and we saw two things: First of all, what case people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when I had been able to put up a 60 when there were only six, 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when I had taken up, only three percent got to buy <unk>
What stood up when there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, I decide that we don't buy <unk> we're probably going to find ourselves -- it's less good for conserving <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices is affecting us in good decisions.
We decided to not decide, even when this doesn't get us <unk>
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we looked at the decisions about savings for retirement for about 650 million Americans, from about 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in looking at whether the number of funds available to the savings plans for retirement -- the <unk> program <unk> people to save for the future.
And we discovered that I actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, even 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of funding was the number of <unk>
So if we look at the ends, we see that in the plans that give two funds, the rate of participation was about 70 or more, not as high as I wanted to.
And in the plans that offered about 60 funds, the rate of participation went into the 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more options, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those that they decided to participate, the more the number of options, more people would be allowed to avoid stocks or hedge funds.
As much more choices, they were more willing to invest in the financial <unk>
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we would argue to optimize the future financial well-being future.
In the previous decade we've seen three main negative consequences by offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is to make the decision that <unk> even when this is going against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less than to pick up less <unk> although objectively it would go better.
The main reason is that we were looking at this giant variety of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations to contrast to contrast and to pick out that amazing <unk>
Today I want to show you to four simple techniques that we have made in a way or another, in different research, so you can try to test it in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, than less is more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're seeing increasingly is that if you decide to cut it, get rid of all weird choices -- there will be an increase on sales, <unk> the costs will be a better experience in the election.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & sentenced to 15, you saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Gate corporation eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that less <unk> were raised by <unk> for two major <unk> and under cost.
You know the supermarket at today, on average, offer 45,000 products.
In a store of Walmart we have about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store largest store in the world is <unk> and it has only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce in detail.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have come up on how to handle the choices is the art of David <unk> the Harvard.
Everybody at Harvard are automatically <unk> to a background of life.
Those who really want to choose, they are giving them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
These are all kinds of choices.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they can't do their <unk> either.
And this afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people in this audience a holiday with all paid to the most beautiful highway in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a round of applause if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Anyone who is ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really had to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information on the first turn, than in the second turn, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to drive the problem of the <unk> which is <unk>
For people to understand differences between options, they have to understand the consequences of each other option, and that the consequences must be very <unk>
Why is people spending 15 percent more on average when they use credit cards or credit cards than when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out to make it be more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get them out more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> who were working on <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
At that meeting, that <unk> exactly how we <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that we gave the staff to think about the positive things that they would think about their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a magazine high school.
We saw that at the road supermarket <unk> across the corridor of <unk> the study of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the rating tells me how to <unk>
These are two pieces of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think that the one on the left is <unk> and the right is <unk> Give you a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think that the one on the left is <unk> and the right is <unk> Give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the right is <unk> But you know something?
This rating framework is totally useless.
The categories must tell you something to <unk> not when they were <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge <unk>
I suppose who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity ...
It turns out we can handle a lot more information than we think, if we just put it a little bit.
We have to increase complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a nice decision and buy a car.
This is a German German manufacturer of cars that can completely <unk>
You have to make 60 decisions to put the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each one.
<unk> out of the car. I have <unk> possibilities.
It was going to be four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order of the order to make the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from a lot of choices, 56 colors, just four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go in a few choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, lots of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How involved you are.
If you were <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates that you're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
What we find is that the ones who go from a lot of choices to the <unk> the default button and again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go in a few options on them, they keep there.
The same information, the same number of choices.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order in which the information is.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although the choice of the change doesn't say anything about the preferences of <unk> interior, in all ways they prepare us to choose.
We are excited about a product that we're building now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> to eliminate alternate alternatives -- we can make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk>
All of these techniques that I've introduced you were designed to help manage the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who are going to work.
I think that the key to get the best of a choice is to be careful to the <unk>
And the more careful we will be in our best choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the years in the 1960s in the East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter to write it to the government.
I had to record a piece of text from the machine.
And this for the government to track the origin of the texts.
If they were writing with the wrong message to be able to track the footprint until the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that somebody could do this, how much that we will give to the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color 3D printer and printing a page, that page will end up having some yellow printed dots on every page that you follow a pattern that makes them really and your printer.
That's happening today.
And no one seems to be a lot like this.
This is an example of the ways our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks of their <unk>
There are three main groups.
They're the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> cell phones is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the <unk> to earn a lot of money, a huge amounts.
There are really many cases of <unk> online <unk> that we would take money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, and <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys are doing their online <unk> but they do it by illegal means using banking to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy on a <unk> computer.
The secret secret service two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this sir, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> hangs <unk> they don't know his <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us are a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this goes from wrong in worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> on importance is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate the protests, they motivate their opinions, they motivate them laughter.
groups like Anonymous have <unk> over the last 12 months occupying a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who do it for money, <unk> as Anonymous who made it to protest and the last group are the United States governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is an authority on the Netherlands, or, actually, it was.
<unk> the <unk> last fall because of a <unk>
We took the safety of the site and perpetrated a <unk>
Last week, I asked a meeting with representatives of the Dutch government who asked one of the leaders if you were <unk> <unk> death from people because of the heart attack.
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from a heart of these?
<unk> is an authority.
<unk> <unk>
So what do you use <unk>
Well, you need to have a website that you need to have a website with <unk> services like <unk>
Except that you would have an authority foreign authority out.
And they were going on with <unk>
And in the case of <unk> exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the headquarters on the secret secret police headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept a big scale of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 500,000 euros to the Afghan government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools for governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a criminal case -- it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's going further.
It was connected to the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and to listen to online discussions to get our data.
When we think closely about things like this the obvious answer should be, "Well, it looks like a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do we <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
Although we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we have today, will be forever.
<unk> blindly in any future government, in a management that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that must be worried about the next 50 years.
This is where I live, I live in Kenya, in the south part of Yellowstone National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, at the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park of Nairobi doesn't have fences in the bulk of the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, they go, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one that they killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning, and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and that's why we value so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
The dying are dying they protect our community and won, and they're also angry with the problem.
So kill lions.
This is one of the six lions they killed in Nairobi.
I think this is just so few in National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, in my community, is responsible for the livestock of his father, and this was the same thing that happened to me to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were afraid of.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because it even helped the lions to see the pen back.
I don't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick the lions to believe that I was near the <unk>
But the lions are very intelligent.  they came up the first day and saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing doesn't move, it's always here.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come.
I found that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a light switch on and shut out the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk>
It was all right.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and the battery will get electricity into the little box <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the box <unk> makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> give up the outside, because that's where the lions.
And that's how you see the lions when they come at night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never got the problems with lions.
And the homes of the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals -- the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see the <unk> You can see the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by all of Kenya, to scare other predators, as hyenas, <unk> and it's also being used to grow back elephants again.
Thank you to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship to one of the best schools of Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funding and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and we set up lights in the houses that they don't have them, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid in rape meadows in my father, and he used to see flying planes and said that someday would be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come back to TED.
My great dream is to become an engineer of aviation and pilot when they grow.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electric <unk>
What is the next thing to your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a fence near CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know you have already invented electric fences -- but I want to do mine.
CA: You know, once, once, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: At the foot of the canyon.
We're going to put it up in every single step that I would take my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would take all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned much about the rest of the world, except that the Americas, South Korea, they are enemies.
Even though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed a flash.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and myself had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When we <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks before.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, that we're ready to die."
I was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering from my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child <unk> in her arms looking at his face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care and their families.
A huge famine <unk> North Korea in <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and satellite cortex.
They also became more and more frequent <unk> all around me, all around me was completely dark at night except for the lights of the sea in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the river <unk> which is the boundary between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, he saw bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I would be separate from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to come back together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be as refugee refugee,
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely hard, but it's also dangerous, because the North Koreans in China were considered illegal immigrants in China.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a fate of turning into North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was made actually, when I was arrested by the Chinese police station, and I was going to take care of the police station.
Somebody had been accused me for being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and asked the questions.
At the end of the <unk> one official told another officer -- "This was a fake report -- she's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum in <unk>
But many can be arrested by Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Even though the previous had were eventually released after serious pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other Koreans have been so lucky.
It's tragic that the Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of their world can be made in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to risk the way to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a huge gap between North and south.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call my pride skills.
Even though I went to life in South Korea that was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the exam exam to college.
Just when I was starting to join my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had a little bit of money that sent to my family, and as punishment my family was going to be shifted to the force to a place away from the <unk>
They had to pick up immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
The Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to do it in a way, for more than 3,000 miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and tackled by the Chinese police officer.
And he asked them to find all of them and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official approached my family, <unk> I stood up and said that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
He looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost my money to bribe the border guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the most low dots in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison to short distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man said, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind asking.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I gave him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans, and it took them to prison.
I put it up with my whole heart, and I asked him, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
<unk> unknown, a new hope for me and for the village <unk> when I was more <unk>
And I showed that the goodness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village needs to need to.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I met in South Korea, and I got together in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is only half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or none of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practices of the English language of work, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us keep in contact with family and we send up information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've been a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans, an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure they're going to see more and more North Koreans around the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Africa.
This is <unk> <unk> stores -- fast food, <unk>
So the city planners got together and thought, we're going to change the name of South Center to represent something else, so they changed the South Angeles as if this <unk> what is actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles --  -- <unk> <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> million other Americans, live in a food machine, Los Angeles South       <unk> to the food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the places of food to carry killed more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles Center.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times older than say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I was pleased to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if they didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come from home you see the effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see chairs from wheels and sold like cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and the solution.
I also got tired of driving 45 minutes back to buy an apple that doesn't have <unk>
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my home.
In a <unk> of land that we call a <unk>
It's about 45 to three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it going.
I said, "Well, I can do anything that comes in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is what I decided to do it.
So my group and I, the Green <unk> we put us together and we started planting our food, <unk> trees -- you know, nine <unk>
What we do, we're kind of paid paid for the way ahead of the way ahead of all the <unk> from all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, I was beautiful.
And then someone gets <unk>
The city came to me, and at <unk> I was given a little bit of a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> made <unk>
And I said, "Come on it?
A court order for planting food on a piece of land that no one <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, let's <unk>
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
The L.A. Times had been written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the Green members who put a request in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, let's go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
It has <unk> <unk>
That's equivalent to 20 Central <unk>
That's enough to plant <unk> millions of tomato plants.
Why the hell does it look like this?
I would build a plant to give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> give you 75 dollars of result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
Your own food is how you print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Center.
And I grew up there. I went to my children there.
I was pleased to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I express my art.
As an artist of <unk> that <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, as a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
They were <unk> to see what the Earth can do, if they leave their canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm a witness of how my garden became a tool of education in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
They were going to be used to see how the kids are.
<unk> is the <unk> act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, they get <unk>
And I remember one occasion, that came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> at night and were in my backyard, and they were seeing very <unk>
I, like, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is in the street for a reason.
I felt embarrassment to see people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, "I don't realize how people go to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Well, I don't have any fear that you go to <unk>
So it's in the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to do it, but at his time, I want you to turn it into your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they shared their stories about how this was affected and how they used to plant with their mom and <unk> and it was fabulous to see how this changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all in a volunteer plan.
If kids grow up, kids will eat <unk>
If you cultivate tomatoes, they will eat <unk>  But if none of these are <unk> if you don't teach them how food affects the mind and your body, eat blind to you in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which you're stuck in, I see the color guys that are on this path designed for them, which doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are getting rid of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington Washington, <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into <unk>
I don't care about it.
I'm not talking about free, because it's free not sustainable.
What curious about sustainability is that you have to be <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try to work on people, take the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
So the <unk> take your <unk> right?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some crap.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with their <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk>  <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road around.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as today, in which it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water on the asphalt that you have to do.
And especially if you're going on on your bicycle and these cars go, that's not very nice.
Moreover, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, you'd want a <unk>
The solution to that is to do roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, and it has pores and water can go through it, so all the rainwater is flow around, and they will have a road that is easy to drive, and you don't have a road that is easy to drive, and you don't get water out of water.
The noise also will disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very hollow, all the noise disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> See that on this road the stones on the surface of the surface goes out.
First of a stone, then then several more and more and more, etc., and <unk> -- well, I'm not going to hurt that.  But they can harm your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, that you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see how the damage comes into this material.
It's one asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if you are <unk> they're going to be <unk> and they will separate from the <unk>
So if you're driving on the road, you'll get the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool <unk> of that to clean up, and we can cut the wool of steel in very small pieces, and we can mix these little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of steel <unk> in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to make a <unk> machine.
<unk> can take. especially steel is very good at that.
So what you need to do is they heat the steel, melt the <unk> the flow of these <unk> and the stones will go back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> because I can't bring the big machine to <unk> this stage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the sample that I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
So we tried lots of samples out there and then the government, you really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We need to be <unk>
So you gave us a piece of road, 400 feet on the <unk> highway, where we had to make a lane of trial to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take lots of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab.
So we made the samples, we put the samples, put a lot of burden on them, we put them together with our <unk> machine, and we took them back to prove it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've done a material using fibers of steel fibers bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, they can even double the life of the surface.
And now, of course, are curious about whether it worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before I can show you how it acts like this.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember I had woken up a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was hearing BBC News in her little gray.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is generally <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> screamed at my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old, when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a kid to <unk> my eldest sister who could no longer be used to go out to a secret school.
It was the only way the two could <unk>
Every day, we took a different route so that no one could suspect where to <unk>
We had to hide the books in market bags so that we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us high in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but it's extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that we would make our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
And once in a while, school was suddenly struck by a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you are.
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total total of a remote province in the remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> where his daughter, my mother, went to school and so his father was doing it.
But my educated mother turned mastery.
This is it.
It was taken two years ago, just to convert our home home to girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite <unk> in spite of risk.
For him, there was a greater risk not to educate their children.
For the years of <unk> I remember there were times when I was very frustrated about our life and she was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can let them leave your house for a war.
But there is one thing that always will be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we'll have it.
So, you don't want to do it.
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country which has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the high school, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I meet here proud to graduate school at <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He was not just <unk> from my university degree, but I was also the first woman, and I'm the first woman who's driving it on the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even more big dreams for <unk>
That's why I am the global champion of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
That's why <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which is still risky for girls to go to school.
What's exciting is I see students at my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I look at his parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> for them, despite the way in front of the opposition <unk>
As <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to his village, and literally escaped to be killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, it's the phone -- a voice <unk> that if they kept sending her daughter to school, they would go back.
<unk> now, if <unk> said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized, in Afghanistan, and it's something that is very often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of whom <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling future of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> girls who went to school in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls are going to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
It turns out that these changes wouldn't be a lot after the retirement of American troops in the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were going to love them, that the <unk> I see a future <unk> and a lasting change.
And for me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day the girls of <unk> I would love it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never go back to a <unk> <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the broke revolution inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution.
A forces with many other citizen citizens inside and outside the country to call a day of rage and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a big revolution.
Women and women who were young, young men were at the <unk> <unk> each of the regime, were <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
Have you shown a bravery copy of the face of the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, to the west to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and a few loss of about 50,000 people dead, we managed to release our country and remove the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and seeds of <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I've wanted, next to a lot of other women, to rebuild civil society -- and a inclusive transition and just towards democracy and national reconciliation and national health."
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm I began to organize workshops about developing capacities, and skills of leadership.
With an incredible group of women we founded the Women of Women who are <unk> by <unk> a movement of women -- leaders, of very <unk> orientation -- to advocate for the women's autonomy of the woman and by our right to participate in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period an environment that was increasingly <unk> than the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, <unk> the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of <unk> old and <unk> <unk>
Another day I <unk> with the news of the American Foundation, and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the Army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and its LGBT rights of human rights from prisoners and their lack of respect about law.
Our society, made by a revolutionary mindset, it gets <unk> more, and it's been away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, which we had at the beginning.
<unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all to do it right now, with our success story of <unk> <unk> and the election.
I am here today to say that we, as a nation, we choose to take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because election didn't get peace, stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation, <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> for men like women?
Perhaps what was missing wasn't just women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than what the election needed to do, that just <unk> the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs female depiction of female more than the <unk> representation of it.
We need to stop acting as <unk> agents and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female discourse that not only <unk> but also putting the mercy in the place of <unk> collaboration instead of the competition, we actually inclusion them instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, spreading war is desperately desperately in order to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> is known to all the <unk> traditions have the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> which spans the whole humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so just like the uterus will cover the <unk> that grows inside the divine matrix of compassion being <unk> all existence.
So he says, "I'm going to tell us, "My mercy takes all the things."
And so he tells us, "My mercy <unk> on my <unk>
That everybody will tell you the good for mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a funny question that has an answer equally <unk>
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is that they all do a usual question: Why is it left?
Why was somebody going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, or an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. At Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City as a writer as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man that I believed my alma mater, I would join my head with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The man who loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun into my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap. of love, where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
Until it could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at <unk> of Business Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been married about 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all race, all of religion -- all of the income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse only happens in relationships, <unk> and <unk> or said in the families, the last place where we would want or hope to find <unk> for which, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would stay with a man who was wearing him and actually went a very typical victim because of my age.
He was 22 years old, and in the United States women between 16 and 24 years old have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls at that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also went a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signs or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and <unk> <unk>
I was sitting next to my side in the subway in New York and started with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had also just been <unk> from a college of <unk> <unk> and working in a very important bank of Wall Street.
But the thing that struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a guy in the field.
He had some big <unk> like apples and <unk> and <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that he made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it mostly at the beginning of <unk>
We began to go out and loved everything from me, who was list, that had gone to Harvard, that I was passionate about helping teenage girls, and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done.
And it was why the bachelor's of that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I was coming from New York and my dreams of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I wanted to quit my job and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling into a <unk> <unk> which was entering the head of a physical <unk> and financial psychological trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to.
And this is where they come into the scene of the <unk>
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where I was supposed to be <unk> I had to feel so safe to buy three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one was placed underneath the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma that lived small.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me and even though I had never run my hand, my life was already serious for each day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, I put my girlfriend on my mother and married him with him.
Despite what had happened, I was confident that we were living happily forever, because I loved him, and he also wanted a lot of it.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was just a lot of sense for the wedding and in fact to form a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I would never make it hurt.
It spent twice the moon of honey.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I was <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our father's moon, she was blown away by the traffic and threw me a Big Mac to the face.
<unk> went to <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was excited when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or at some time of his life, and the Centers for Disease Control -- that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why am I going to tell me.
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to tackle their <unk>
The other question everyone is doing is, why don't you just not <unk>
Why don't I <unk> I could have been at any time.
For me this is the saddest question and painful questions that people do because we have the victims, we know something that normally you're going to do is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the murder in domestic violence happen after the victim has put the end to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to married, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system to protect the victim and their children, who are normally forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who <unk> their mother.
And we still follow why it's simply not <unk>
I was able to go, because of a last <unk> <unk> to beat my denial.
I realized that the man who I loved so much, I would have killed if he would have allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told all the world to the police, to my neighbors and my friends and family and full unknown, and I'm here today because all of you are <unk>
We have the tendency to oppose the victims as the headlines of the <unk> women <unk> <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people it's a way to say <unk> as if the <unk> victims were <unk> by <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also claim that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them and they nurture their lives and lives of life joyful and happy lives and mothers like <unk> wives like mine.
Because it turns out that I am actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence as well.
I was marrying a <unk> and kind I have these three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm going to do is never even more -- ever is a pistol and put my head into the hands of someone who says I want.
At this point, I are just thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, who are being <unk> or they were <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
The abuse could be affecting his daughter, her sister, their best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love to breaking the silence.
And I keep doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
Spider abuse will be only in silence.
They have the power to end up domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
<unk> need all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the abuse of light talking about it with their children, their coworkers and family and family.
<unk> their view of survivors as fantastic and fantastic people who have a future <unk>
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene very consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims of a safe way.
Together, we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis safe and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment there is a very uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dress up like this.  Luckily, I brought up clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing on a stage of <unk> so you have a lot of fortune <unk> I think.
If some of the women were getting <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to go back now, but find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These days, they're very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going to go through the head, because it's when they're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything as I cover your head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, he had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
And he was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I was able to put on the back and put the hair out of the kid.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan as the one that I made two days ago for work, there are very little we can do to transform our looks, which, although superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, will be courageous it means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how is it going to be model?
And I say, <unk> <unk> was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made it model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this inheritance.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed to <unk> we've also been associated with a high and <unk> shape to the <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my heritage heritage, that I have known to harness to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now showing <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> from the fashion that are <unk> Hold out -- they're <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk>
First of all, you know, <unk> to know so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told all and each of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, <unk> just -- to say, less than four percent, were not white ...
So the next question that people always ask me is, can it be model when it is older.
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't care about that.
But then, what I would really tell each of these girls is, Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> surgeon ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you would be the first.
If after this spectacular list, they still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of writing American magazine or the executive CEO of <unk> or next Steven <unk>
To say you have to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's <unk> it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Sadly, once you've finished your studies, your studies, and you have a resume and some jobs on your back, no matter what you want, you know, if you want to be president of the United States, but your resume <unk> of underwear for 10 years, people would look at you.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yeah, pretty much <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
So this was the first picture that I would tell you, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a child.
This is what it looks like next to my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party, a few days before the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team, and in magazine <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you will realize I'm not me in those photos.
They are <unk> of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is to make things for free?
I have too many inches of about 20 inches and I have never use, except the few previous ones, but the privilege I get to get in the real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the free <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> got a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> and I was sorry, agent and <unk>
<unk> of these privilege for me, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their meaning regardless of who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of the teenagers who were <unk> and 86 percent were black and Latino women, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black people in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
But how many times do I get <unk>
By looking at this talk, I found out that the 53 percent of the girls in 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that figure comes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer you're expecting is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the most bright hair, you'll feel very happy and I'm going to tell you.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to be able to work with creative people, ingenious and passionate people.
And that's all right, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with a little bit more thin legs and the most bright hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the <unk> legs -- the brightest hair and clothes more than fashion -- but it's probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to look at a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to retain this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable to recognize the power of the image in the perception of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since it was enough enough to hold a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 more <unk> photos -- and I didn't know who <unk>
There were no directors and no <unk> no chance to repeat the pictures, not even a minimal care in the enlightenment.
In fact, most of them were taken by an randomly.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and 5.
He took the chance we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you back to New York on a <unk> journey, and you follow the <unk>
This is when we started to ask for the tourists that they were going to give us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, never nobody has <unk> with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much it would change life this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day so that a five-year-old could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a particular moment or a specific journey.
They are also a way of stopping time on a week of October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because although we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we expect with illusion all the year.
And so recently, in one of the trips, we were walking around, when suddenly she stopped in my tracks and signal a red <unk> of the baby's tent, and he <unk> a little bit of the previous <unk>
And he described to me what I felt at five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things that we created are memories.
So, I want to share the idea of actively engaging in conscious creation.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in a lot of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that comes up with it.
I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and you don't want to be able to come up with somebody and ask her, get a picture?
Thank you.
And I want to talk to you about a very special group.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most skilled birds group.
First of all, why are they so bad <unk>
It's also been associated with Disney laughter, <unk> as a stupid silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press, laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament -- but I don't accept.
I don't accept. Do you know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment clean --  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> are better presence.
There are the <unk> of the New World War that are mainly in <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the former World World, where we have 16 species -- these 16, 11 issues facing a high risk of extinction.
So why are they important? Why are they important? First of all, they provide ecological services, vital services.
They're our <unk> of natural garbage <unk>
<unk> the carcasses of the bone.
They help kill all bacteria. They help to absorb the anthrax that of not being for them would stretch and caused great losses from livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times as much time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge <unk> importance.
They've been associated with the ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of protective and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between 100 and using Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of Tasmanian <unk>
In <unk> culture, they do very important <unk> in the open sky in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities, use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, <unk> are victims of this.
In the south of Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critically critical list of extinction, that means that in less than 10 or 15 years, and the reason is because they fall prey from the livestock consumption that have been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinarian in India and have taken a posture.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs have a huge bomb bomb, and the number of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be above Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind power, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to the birds, they cut them in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there is a horrible trade trade, to serve the <unk> and the market <unk>
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, and so focus on a locally living problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that we make.
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you to focus on these very distinctive creatures, <unk> their time to spread the word.
When you leave this room, I will tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw without effort, without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do <unk> my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I'm not who I am.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> <unk> and Somalia. in projects of African cooperation with African countries.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> the 21, which Italians were good at, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of all the things that we're going to do is <unk>
Our first project, which was inspired by my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where I wanted to teach people about country to grow food.
So we got to the seeds of <unk> in the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the <unk> River, and we teach the local to grow tomatoes Italians and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they would take them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't know.  We were so sure that the <unk> in such fertile valley, had not had agriculture.
But instead of asking you how it was possible that we would not forget anything, we just said, "Thank God that we are here   <unk> in time to save the people on the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato would grow to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look at how easy it is.
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> came from the river and ate all of it.  And we said it all.
And the <unk> said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
I thought only did the Italians do it in Africa, but then I saw what Americans, what they did, what they were doing -- what they were doing, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to look at the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that we gave them to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, reading <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western organizations, we have delivered to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from a African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people just from two vehicles or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as my kids, "I want a lot.
<unk> I deal with all of those of us in a different culture as my <unk>
That's why white people in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face. "The small thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all about economic development -- if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to have the 27 years to answer people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you never hit anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? It <unk>
It would never come to a community with an idea, and sit with people in the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a coffee. We sat down in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give yourself an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what are you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find the knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years ago, and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for once, they would tell them, but not in community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There is a problem with the meetings in the classroom.
The entrepreneurs never had, and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance has identified.
So, planning has this blind point.
The most clever people in their community, you don't even even know it, because they don't attending your public meetings.
What do we do? We work one one, and we work face to face, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You have to create a new career.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the medical doctor of the business, which is established with you in their house, on the table of your kitchen and the coffee table -- and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was making a Ph.D. in that time, trying to move away from this condescending garbage that we get to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to me to see what you can do that?
How can I do that? And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
And so the government is <unk>   So the government says, again."
We have helped make 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers racing from history, passed away in '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they become involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
Humor is the kiss from the death of the business spirit.
So now I <unk> <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come up with you.
You have to offer you to have no privacy, it has to be fantastic to <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What are you going to show you more than this tomorrow?
People were <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I'm telling you is that the <unk> spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution, <unk> fossils of <unk> and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There is no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
government?
They will be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story that was in a high-tech magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> they gathered this group of people together and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move into the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced for six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in rice --  -- so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States appeared <unk> generic manufacturers <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise they won't come to a conversation with you.
Then you have to offer you a dedicated <unk> service.
And then later you have to tell you about the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the bigger company has to be able to do three things -- the product you want to sell it has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic marketing company, and you have to have a great financial administration.
Guess what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can be done, sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at and looked at the 100 companies iconic companies in the global world, and <unk> Ford -- all the new, Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all companies in the world have in common, only one: None of it was started by one person.
The word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
Nobody begins a company alone.
So, we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in coffee bars in bars along with their dedicated comrades who will do for you, what somebody did for this gentleman who are talking about this gentleman who will ask you, what needs to need?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> you can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we're not buying a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> which <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust in a city.
It always gives music to music.  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the largest number of U.S. abandoned properties.
I live close to this house and thought about how it could turn it into a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who I loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
He was sudden and unexpected and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and a lot.
And it made me a deep gratitude for the life of the living time.
It gave the meaningful things of my life today.
But let me take you through this look in my daily lives.
I think it's easy to be able to get off the day and forget the really important for one.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this left house on a giant board and painted on her sentences for <unk> Before he died <unk>
So, <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and sharing personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to expect this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled with and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I died, I want to be judged by <unk>  "Before I die, I want to sit on <unk> on the line of <unk>
Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I died, I want to take you once more."
Before I died, I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
Before I died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and the hopes of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort at tough times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving back the reflection and the <unk> and remembering what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people that wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues of civic center we did a kit, and now they've been made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is the time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions in the rising age, it is more important than ever, to find ways to conserve the perspective and remember that life is brief and fragile.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that prepare for death is one of those things that we have more power.
Think about the death of our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better than us as individuals and as community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us cannot help us improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 and very hot.
No speech, but it's transmitting joy than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It's shared <unk> what happens.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
You don't care about religious differences and notice this: it's never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to say words that I don't even think of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's high. It's very hot.
Let's bring the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but remember the year that he came out each of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, she would be sitting in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
They don't seem <unk>
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal, it's often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even if you didn't consider them inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing: which was <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, to learning, and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, from there that <unk> is so different than Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is to be diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the developing disorders that fast increases in the world, there's no cause or <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new self in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
It was a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I was pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in a row around the room, looking at the washing machine, and eating anything that would have <unk>
As it was growing up, it would come back more different, and the differences became more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> had something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature of a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, times I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that would not want to change for normal.
<unk> passes through the beauty that give us the differences and the fact that it will be different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could give you a single thing to <unk> and to Sam and for you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that are <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift inside of its interior, and honestly, the search for normal, is the last <unk> of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change in the moment where we try to be the rest of them.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what has been to be <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a communications of communications, giving a class of communication to graduate engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> of fact, <unk> of these students with their great minds, their great books and their great unknown words.
But when you develop those conversations -- I felt what I was going to have -- must have sense when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
Just so I felt when I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a big communication.
We desperately need a huge communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our biggest challenges from the environment and health care and health care and health care -- and if we don't know what we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions on how they can do that to make sure that their science is sexy and its engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why is science relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that they study the <unk> but study <unk> that are the <unk> structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing their science, care about <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> affordable is not the same thing to make things.
Instead, as Einstein, said that everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without compromise ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, and stories and analogies. They are ways and <unk> with their content.
And when you present their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you been asked by why they call <unk>  What do you do <unk> bullets killed and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's supported too much in the language of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the unique Tower Tower <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase -- <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then they provide graphs that will fit our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what they <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help others open the door and look at the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from the entire Oxford English <unk> is <unk>
It just sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was a <unk> editor of the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that looking for public and no matter <unk> and the beginning, and when he won, it gets made by the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means to <unk>
I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all the politicians know that they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed the words to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> chamber.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who was faced with <unk>
They put her in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to cope with them, and at the end of it he had such a popular support in London I won
And just a few years later we had the first record of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most of them think it's true.
It's not. It's because of an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you how words and policy interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., right after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were presented with all kinds of suggestions that might have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call him <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the American <unk> <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about quality.
And not even with that were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected by King for a given term.
And I could have <unk>
Everybody got tired of, <unk> because this debate was taken for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and I was always going to do it with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want to be Washington in power.
They didn't want to call it King if he was going to give him or her subsequent ideas.
So they wanted to give the title more <unk> and more unfortunate title that we had happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. It didn't invent the title. There was just before, but it only meant <unk> that I would have a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a <unk> title.
And that's why the Senate was <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign up treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take a very ridiculous title with a <unk> and baby <unk> like President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't exist.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite one where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as the President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to keep waiting for <unk>
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this -- is that the title of President of the United States doesn't sound so modest at all.
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads at stake, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of flying air vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story has touched the title of <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> -- well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So at the end of the Senate I won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're now President of <unk>
And I think that's the big lesson we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
The politicians try to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but actually the reality changes a lot more than the words that they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 at a foot underground in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is topped heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but above all, that cacophony of <unk> <unk> and stones with primitive.
Like others, I carry a cheap <unk> of light <unk> he holds his head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole out of a meter that drops hundreds of meters on the ground.
It was <unk> my hand, and suddenly I remember a mining that I met before, who lost the control and she fell into <unk> feet on that toilet.
As I talk to you today, these guys are deep deep on that hole, and their lives without paying a reward, and often, dying.
I went home from that hole, and I went home but they might never will.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents and 2009, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Mexican <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> from <unk> the <unk> an NGO who has to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I began to learn about slavery because I knew there was in the world but not in a grade.
When we end up talking to me, I felt very nasty <unk> I was honestly trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> and weeks later, I flew in L.A. to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and I offer my help.
So it started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Even a couple of my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced during the entire slave <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of the <unk> of <unk>
But today, you can be enslaving entire families for generations, for generations of <unk> dollars.
But amazingly, slavery is generated by over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to find that they're forced to work without payment, under threat of violence and can't escape.
Today slavery operates in <unk> the goods produced by slaves are value, but those who produce are disposable things.
<unk> exists in almost everybody and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and <unk> I met the bricks.
This strange and winning show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at a temperature of 54 degrees -- men, women, children, in fact, entire families -- in fact, <unk> in a heavy, <unk> <unk> <unk> bricks in their head, until 18 at the time, and they take them from the furnaces to the time, and they take them out of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work silent, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no paper to eat, or to drink, and the severe <unk> made it just quite <unk>
So <unk> was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to touch it, and it stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera is a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was very quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained very clearly that to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not only for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, anything.
I was not citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation that they were already about.
I had to trust the <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his release and trusted and he trusted him to <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found children carrying these stones on <unk> <unk> until trucks they expected down.
Those big <unk> were cooler than the kids used to charge and children <unk> their heads with <unk> <unk> made by <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all their life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers were <unk> their freedom, the <unk> gained <unk>
When we hear the word slavery we often think of sexual traffic and because of this world consciousness was told to me that it would be hard for me to work safely in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
I was driven by a little stairs <unk> that gave this <unk> <unk> <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they are local for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms, private rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of the seven years -- are forced to entertain the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Every year is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their hands.
From the <unk> I remember making sense of <unk> <unk> and, in that moment, I could barely imagine what should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where I was going.
There was no door doors.
There were no windows as well as to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we touch a serious topic, it's important to point out slavery even sexual trafficking, happens around us.
There are hundreds of people born in agriculture, at domestic service, and the list can go on.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex as sex.
This is everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles is another activity that often with <unk> labor.
And I went to Indian villages where they were full families in the <unk>
This is a family.
The black hands of black are the parent, the blue <unk> and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, though, that we can go out of this house someday and go to another place where you pay our job."
It's been estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When I arrived there, I was going to take a quick look fast.
I saw what seemed to be a <unk> family on a boat, two older brothers, some younger kids -- it makes sense, right?
<unk> were all slaves.
The children are separated from their families who were <unk> and forced to work a extensive deal on these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me -- he was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The <unk> branches of trees involved in Lake <unk> often catch networks and children, <unk> and fear is thrown into the water to unlock the branches.
Many are <unk>
Since <unk> has always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and as all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> is about the youngest slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they took the last networks, but they had been working on the one time.
It was cold and <unk>
And it would be point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> out of a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with her wanted.
It asked us to put it on a land road to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we moved out of the car, and he asked the driver that went out quickly.
Then you signal this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started down -- we took the <unk> that <unk> the path and after walking around an hour we found that the way was driven by the recent <unk> so I put the team of pictures over my head as they went into these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> ended up in an clear, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a football field, and everybody was full of migrant workers.
A lot of women had their children tied their back, and while they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a pump in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> are all up to 90 feet and these people have got some heavy stone bags and then they'll be shipped to another area where they were throwing the rock to get the gold.
In the first sight, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closer, we see other less lucky ones, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ended up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died he led him to work with him in mines.
By dying their uncle, <unk> I inherit the debt of the uncle to be slave into the mines.
When I met him, I had worked in the mines 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident on the <unk> so that doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet that is forced to work night and day in that mine.
Even so, he dreams about being released and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, to face a remote possibility that makes me inspire a lot of respect.
I want to throw light out of slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we're going to give a witness to them and to make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves from each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. It's of people, real people, like you and I, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I don't think of in these many beautiful people, <unk> I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images wake up a force when you see them in people like you, and I hope that force turns out a fire and that fire <unk> light about slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do some applied math and there's a peculiar problem for whom we do, we are like management methods.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We gave up the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk> --  that we'll see later.
But a degree of a degree of training is a degree of extraordinary training a high level of dexterity and probably some <unk> initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Sadly, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease -- gradually this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at their time, was a virtuous dancer <unk>
In the last few years, it's been involved in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we can know if there is actually a cure when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement of the movement of the movement of the movement that they don't use the blood analysis and the best we have is a <unk> exam exam <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of clinical trials, they never do.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if the patients could take the test of them ourselves?
It wouldn't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars.
So what I want to do with you as a kind of no conventional way for a try, you see, in a sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of the elastic ropes.
It shows someone as long as it gives sound to the talk, we can imagine as a dancers of a vocal ballet dancers because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes called <unk> for example.
And how did they did -- it requires a remarkable level of training.
Take the time that leads to a child learning to talk.
From sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as <unk> and as the Parkinson's affects the <unk> also affect the <unk> organs.
And in the traces of the bottom you can see a irregular <unk> of string ropes.
We see the same <unk>
Best <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the clinical trials -- well, they're both <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
They are both precise <unk> OK, but also <unk> tests in voice are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're very much cost, and we all know what happens to happen.
When something takes a cost of mass cost, it appears to massive scale.
These are some amazing lists for <unk>
We can reduce the problems of the patients.
It would not have to go to the clinic for a pregnancy for routine.
<unk> high-speed data <unk>
We could make massive <unk> for clinical trial for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So by giving you the first steps in that sense, we're launching the <unk> Initiative of the disease.
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these targets.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> or without <unk> can call under the price and leaving recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've had six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.  Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all of these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who doesn't it?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, what happens is that during the so-called <unk> you have to indicate if you have or not the disease.
<unk> You see, some people may not <unk> You may not do it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the pleasure of confusion for the real markers of disease.
TR: You have a <unk> of accuracy at this point?
It was much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network, as well, what we did -- the project -- now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max public <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We specialize in the dark, in rooms with no windows and, typically, we avoid sunlight.
We make the thin thin models, the perfect skin -- the perfect skin we are doing the impossible possible and we would be involved in the press all the time, but some of us are really a artists with talent with many years of experience and a true taste by the images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Shortly after an organization where I was <unk> there was a <unk> where <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, together with hundreds of other volunteers we heard that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishermen living in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The level of recorded water has reached over 24 feet tall, more than three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the mud and we leave the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish from dead fish, <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We <unk> and we loved it.
And for weeks, because volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> of pictures and cameras and <unk> cards.
They all did the same thing.
We would take them to different places in the villages of around the <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the town.
It helped clean the toilets, the huge <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And they had the honor that he had and I had the honor that he was holding on to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspirational I had heard of the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until beyond myself my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years old, some were still in the lab, I couldn't help to think about how to fix it, how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive and I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too much <unk> but where the water had changed: the face of the girl was supposed to be very accurately and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time step of time, they got a lot more photos, and they needed more <unk> so I went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries were offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a village town north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the temporal libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, dependent on the <unk> of the photos.
It could be an hour. It could be a couple of weeks.
It could be a few months.
This <unk> had to draw a lot of hand using the areas that color and detail the water had no <unk>
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures <unk> in saltwater, covered with bacteria, even with seaweed, even with oil, all of it along with the time step of the time -- I continue to <unk> it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't get the photo unless it was clean <unk> and it would have been rewarded for his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the pictures of <unk>
As he once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was really lucky in relation to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> she itself but stopped when he realized that they would get them even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face would not be able to share, we could put the images in a single picture and put the whole picture.
When collected their pictures shared some of his history with us.
A colleagues in her husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble of the rubble far from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues <unk>
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside of the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their young children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took him a week to find all his family and know that they were all surviving.
The day I gave her his child his youngest son to her 14 years.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could go back to look, something that I could remember from the past day that he had gone out of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up there -- hundreds of them were helped to clean up more than <unk> photographs, the great <unk> -- the vast majority went into their hands of their <unk>
Over 500 volunteers around the world helped us back to 90 families -- hundreds of different photos of photos and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend over a thousand dollars in teams and materials, most of them on ink to <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, and somebody loved.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would take but the first thing that we want to look for.
This is about the project to restore little bits of humanity, to bring somebody back their connection to the past.
When a picture of this comes back to someone, it was a huge difference in the life of the person that you get.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected to something bigger with something bigger -- to bring something, using their talent for something that they don't be thin models of perfect skin.
And I would like to read this electronic email -- I would like to read this electronic email -- the day I came back from Japan after six months.
While <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular picture, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> me because a picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my <unk> daughter, <unk> hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, in all of our basic needs are the <unk> right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibit of only one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion or a billion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique so fast that you can create a slow camera of light motion.
And with that we can create cameras that can see behind the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or seeing the interior of the body without using X-rays, and they really challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch on it and put it into a second <unk> it means in a number of <unk> to create a <unk> package of just a millimeter wide width just a millimeter wide <unk>
And that package is, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common <unk>
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do they remove those photons into this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --   Remember that all this is actually happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see light moving.
Coke didn't look at this research --  -- so many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a package of photons that starts to <unk> and that, inside it starts to <unk>
Part of the light goes down to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a <unk> bubble that bounce inside the inside.
And at that time, the waves travel down the table and because of the insights in the top of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights are <unk>
Now, if we take a regular cat and current and we make it run the same distance and we see it at slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to see that film?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie --  -- a slow slow on motion.
And what about testing <unk>
You can see the waves that get away from the table of tomato and the wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at a time, but of course, our eyes can see a full composition of it.
But if you look at this one and more and more of this tomato will realize that, as the light goes extinct. You still miss it.
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounce inside its interior, and it comes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is on your phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is mature without having to <unk>
So what do we create this camera at MIT for.
As the photographers, you know, if we take a <unk> picture, you get very little light.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the shortest one, so I just get into some light.
So we sent that <unk> that <unk> package billion times, and we recorded over and over again with very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in crude and sort of interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, other heroes.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow you to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple light bulbs.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique capabilities in it.
It has a good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also to the hidden objects but we don't know what point corresponds to which a distance.
And when a laser, I can record a laser picture, which you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we'll try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
Can we see it in <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's going on on the road.
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected by opening up.
Or we could build <unk> capable of seeing the interior of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood is pretty hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new visualization mode to solve the problems of mammography health care problems.
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, I became science in art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all of the data data we collected every time is not just for scientific scientists, but we can see them.
And creating a new form of computational photography with slow motion and color code.
And look at those <unk> remember, the time between each of those waves is just about <unk> of a second.
But here is also something that's fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> they're going to leave us.
<unk> should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects to the Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order that the events occur in the world sometimes is going on in front of the camera.
We have the corresponding corresponding of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone, and your life gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song, let me move it into <unk> and become famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 living in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this town.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to look for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people gathering out that we were looking for a change, they had a cell phone in our pocket.
Who should be a cell phone here?
<unk>
Put your mobile phone, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
That's a lot of these today have a cell phone.
But today, I'm going to talk about my cell phone, and how life changed me.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. introduced a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> of <unk>
This directive says that every mobile phone company, every single Internet provider in Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the cell phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored by at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company or their Internet <unk>
And in all Europe people planted and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone and the Internet providers, all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets in Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
<unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> <unk> who was then the largest telephone company in Germany, which for me to get away all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to them, and I didn't get a particular answer, and it was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a lawsuit in court because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end of it <unk> an agreement.
Would you look at the demand and send me to send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly <unk> with a CD in it.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand miles of information.
And I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge file. Okay.
But after a while I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the <unk>
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and go ahead and go forward.
You can see every step I ever did.
And you can see how I'm going to train them on the train to <unk> and what I often call the path.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little bit of fear.
But it's not just me.
It's about all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big network of communication.
You can see how people communicate each other to what time they call each other, what time you sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who who is talking to who, who sends an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in our pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, it would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall, maybe never had happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today public agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible within the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives, and they want to change them forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they go back home to their friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century and that is not quite fashion.
When you go home to your representative who just because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information do you do?
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to remind them to remember that you have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi three: What happens?
It's not enough.
Hi three: What happens?
My name is <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
I went back to my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
and Muhammad <unk>
The P. C is not genetics.
It's not <unk> no <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus in my mother, not <unk> because my parents were brothers, although they are.
It's just about accidents, as I came up at birth.
Now, I'm not a source -- I'm not a source of inspiration.
It's sorry for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be disabled.
Go for a ride.
<unk> of Christmas, are in the shopping mall, they drive in circles looking for parking and what do you see?
16 places empty for disabled places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I am <unk> Muslim <unk> disabled and living in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same first.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't think about <unk> se puede" moment.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters. If my three older sisters. I would do.
If my three older sisters were going to the public school, my parents went to the school system, and I was afraid that I was going, and if we didn't take all of the maximum note -- all of my <unk>
My father taught me how to walk to the age of five years by putting my <unk> in her feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me so that you get it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong, and ...
Yeah. The first day in kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion who has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they're still all of the family --  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think would start to use <unk> to the <unk> as a slogan of the campaign.
The people I grew up with no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> that was dying of starvation during the <unk>
I told you that I had enough fat in order to live three full <unk> and so <unk> of the dawn is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't pay the physical therapy, so I was sent to school dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I do too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer holidays in the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were going to lie in <unk>
On the summer of the summer, I was often my father trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> I was getting coffee cups on the back, I was sitting in the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the cure cure was the yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before you do yoga was a comedian of <unk> that I couldn't stand foot <unk>
And now I can focus on your head.
My parents would come up with this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a fellowship for the University of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> pet <unk>
You all love me.
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the maximum note in my classes, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass zoo my professors at all.
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral palsy,
I was a girl with cerebral palsy,
So I started screaming at four <unk> when I started to get a <unk>
I've got <unk>
At the end of the end of the end, the end of it.
Thank God <unk> at the end of I'm <unk>
I didn't get the role.  They gave <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running the head of the theater department, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, and ask her why and she told me that because they thought I couldn't do the risk stunts
And I said, <unk> if I can't do stunts -- you can't do the <unk> either.
It was a paper that was literally born and gave it to an actor.
<unk> was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled actors.
As I graduated back home, and my first <unk> tour, it was an extra one in a <unk>
My dream came true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was evident to me that the <unk> work is not <unk>
Just give them to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I became <unk>
On my first tour, I took famous comics from New Jersey to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that led to when he fell at high speed on the head of New Jersey with a bus that had cerebral palsy,
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, no censorship and without <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival in New York City, now in his 10 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in media and to remind the <unk> directors that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs were much easier to fight the stigma challenge of disabilities.
My big opportunity came in 2010.
I was invited to invite the news program to Keith <unk>
I walked into a graduate dance and I joined a study and sat me on a <unk>
And I looked at the director, and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I held up at the desk desk in order to not come out on the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
At the end of I had my opportunity and I knew that they didn't have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just as I got my chair and pasted my chair.
Something kind of fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that kids are <unk> but they never get away from me and a little girl or older.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
Let's write online clips with comments like, "Why do you work?"
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What disease does it have?
We really should pray for her."
A <unk> suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as a race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't make someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yeah, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were telling you that I don't know.
However, I have grown up with media, but I don't think we <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday lives.
Maybe if there were more positive images -- that would be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all the society to teach well our children.
My journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> the red carpet by the <unk> of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> this incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in a great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded "The <unk> <unk> a charity to give the children Syrian refugee children -- a tiny part of what my parents gave me.
It was the only time my father saw me living in live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
My name is <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can also can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
He lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This is about <unk>
<unk> drives a small town to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it's going to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there are no opportunities -- there is no job, no <unk>
He just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year I had a year -- nothing.
One day you read about a gentleman who offers him to <unk> after for dinner, to <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, who gives it a break.
He gets a little bit of money for buying new clothes, money to send home to their family.
They present to a young lady.
I finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, <unk> a bomb.
That child in that small village with the dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist team, and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> a connected terrorist organization to al Qaeda.
So how a story of a child in a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends up with him.
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start their future, waiting a perspective of the future, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that he took it out of what we call "the <unk> period.
And their story is replaced around the world centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young people who were born riots in <unk> riots in London who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of jobs, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth who suffer from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people who live in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunity, the story of <unk> <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence, to be the story of 2.0 cities.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of young people is <unk>
And 70 percent don't work not to school.
They do practically nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit Mr. <unk> hospital where I was born.
I remember being in front of that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I never gone?
And if I had been forced to be on that same <unk>
It would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support a few local leaders in a business account.
<unk> up to about 90 juvenile leaders.
We sat down, and we had a <unk> of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunities.
I remember when he told me that because he was a graduate university college -- frustrated, was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to the point A to the B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war has destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a company from <unk>
He started <unk> motorcycle residents who were normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand to hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this different story do?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers to your <unk> <unk> we were plastic from sent from abroad.
If you give someone, to somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
He created a farm outside <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for wedding -- creating gardens in the houses, and the companies of the city, and now it's working on creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks.
He wants to create a space where the families, the young families, can go together, and, as he says, smell the pink rose <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought to start a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO, to work for government, but their history, their innovation, actually had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
It encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that might be <unk> of the change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, inspired young people and create a culture of entrepreneurial spirit is really a big step, but young people need to have capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and guidance in the development and put out of their businesses.
<unk> young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support they need to move from conception to creation, and create a <unk> for the urban growth.
For me, the corporate spirit is something else to start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her <unk> of <unk> this is how it calls it when it is created, and it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep <unk>
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is that my suggestion is to turn young people into entrepreneurs, <unk> and feeding their innovation innovation and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks <unk> than <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about ten years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> mountains, an area in upstate New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun makes the leaves leaves like a <unk> and it's not going to be on the way that we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to step onto that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed on a <unk> with sight of a beautiful <unk> lake.
Behind the shed was a <unk> of about four square meters with hearts with <unk> <unk> balls of paper and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get what they thought they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question kept with me, and he was getting a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how you <unk> or where to <unk> the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash -- on the reason of 11 tons of waste -- and two thousand tons of <unk> <unk> every day.
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through his routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get more.
So I began to work like garbage cans.
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And operated the mechanical <unk> and <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe it, and in the days that it's very strong you get to become very strong and quickly.
It costs a lot of used to weight.
I met people who had been working on it for several years, and their bodies kept <unk> the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage every weeks.
It's also danger.
According to the Office of Statistics <unk> waste is one of the top ten <unk> most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all the day and they pass around.
They just want to be <unk> so generally the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the <unk>
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that are often left on the truck and cause terrible people.
I also learned about the relentless <unk>
When you get out of the <unk> you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the trash is as a force of nature itself.
It's never coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It should always be moving.
And it's also the stigma.
I think the stigma is especially ironic because I believe strongly that the waste <unk> are the most important labor of the city streets for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of the waste and effective <unk> every day, this starts to <unk> their containers and your dangers inherent <unk> they threaten us in real ways.
Disease that we had controlled for decades and centuries come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have space for the new thing that the drivers of the economy start to fail when the consumption is endangered.
I'm not advocating by capitalism, I just pointing your relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average speed we need.
So what I'm talking about is simply how fast we used to move in <unk>
We usually didn't care about it, and we had no gas <unk> or we had our coffee cup -- our coffee cup -- our water bag and our water <unk>
We use them, we forgot about them, because we know that there's a work force on the other side that it will take away from it.
So I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about waste waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable city and human city.
Their work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when you <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
It's almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us except for ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow has always to stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection truck in the street, I grabbed my son, <unk> the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his journey of paper <unk> as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be OK."
Shortly after that, I started looking at waste waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we worked a lot of times and we made good friends.
I want to believe it was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we should include and realize all the costs, even the real human cost of labor.
The municipal waste what we think when we talk about garbage represent three percent of the waste amount of nation.
It's a remarkable statistic
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one to see someone whose job is to clean the crap from you, you will give you a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to say thank you.
My work is focused on the connection to thinking about our community life, forming a part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought up with two recent projects that I brought to this today.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a <unk> center of a bunch of stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, my team and me, on what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people cannot afford to buy things.
Second, you need to spend a lot of energy because of the skin lining that takes heat into the interior, so it takes a lot of <unk>
In a city that this should not happen because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And thirdly, it has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a pity for a rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted with the old market that is this open air structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There is also that idea of using the public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building of various stories by applying these principles.
The next challenge was introduced to the <unk> which is located in a lot of growth in the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, don't exist.
And in addition to two different parallel streets that don't communicate in a hundred meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, assembling all the entries in the building.
And this goes with an <unk> atrium, that it creates an open air space in the building that will spread through its own form of sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the market idea with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we would bring to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue like a <unk> concrete <unk> to allow the air to air and also of the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we get inspired by these beautiful buttons from the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that are going to move the air and light in a way controlled inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little color crystals that use the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it was not easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It wasn't what they did.
But in fact, we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center because in order to reach out there were more local to sell.
And the idea of the facade was far more economic -- not just because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have <unk>
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy power to the building in a city where electricity is almost every day.
So we get a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this inner city.
And these <unk> on the roof, which together collect water for inner power.
It's expected for the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project that is so big, the biggest thing that I have designed, and I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, their tradition and the culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention to <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a <unk> wall that was surrounded by a almost straight.
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was expand the streets of existing streets by creating 12 initial blocks in size and features that are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we selected some strategic points in relation to the idea of the <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So let's take a scheme to make sure that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then on the low plant, we have all the connections to <unk>
And it also responds to local norms that set a higher density in higher levels and a lower density in the lower plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving into the community space that is occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and get up and make activities such as running a <unk> career in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design design.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes communities and local economies at the same rate of buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and that have a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had huge amounts of hair and a very bright <unk> of <unk> I was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year, and I was full of jealousy, until I had my sinister plan.
One day I stayed in time after school <unk> I was a little late and I hid in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took off the table of my teacher from grades.
And then I did.
I had the report on my <unk> just a little bit, just some like this.
All like that.  And I organized myself to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all around the rows of <unk> and myself a row for me -- just for being there, because I was going to be there.
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never care about.
It's that it was all obvious <unk>
I will never tell you.
But above all, I was struck by the reason why I was very small, was so good for <unk>
They <unk> the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also bird abuse are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of children.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab where they study them in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no exaggeration to say that if there was no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> it would have no <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
No Shakespeare.
<unk> the <unk> <unk> lists because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No jealousy, no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the jealousy, almost of them have all of them.
This year is 100 years of his masterpiece, "In <unk> of the time <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> -- everything we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it comes from books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know how it is the cat <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they're so good together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the jealousy, who are reduced to the person, to their wish, to their <unk> are a good narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel wrong.
Being both <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details that we <unk> the knife is, right?
<unk> make us all novelists <unk> and that's something that I understand.
All that she does to give me pleasure could give pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say that story, and since then, <unk> says that every single charm that <unk> detects in his lover, he adds it to her collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
Is it an emotion <unk> You have to do it.
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
At <unk> they like large amounts of hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> were <unk> from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  -- <unk> links the language of jealousy.
When <unk> is in his father's agony of soon listening to the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover and then defending those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's a scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for the search of truth, a really painful truth -- a painful truth -- in fact, to what to <unk> the more painful the truth, better.
The pain, <unk> <unk> These were the pathways towards <unk> wisdom.
He says, "A woman who we need, which makes us suffer, it causes in us a much deeper feelings and vital feelings that a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
Is there any other excitement to us, our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look with intensity <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young man who was being used by the idea that her woman did it.
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man, which was not <unk> in what his wife did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion with no cause.
But he was looking for things that his wife, and he didn't realize <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or accidentally <unk>
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
<unk> describe very well how the <unk> are going to look with intensity but <unk>
And in fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more of us in the savings of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent acts and illegal.
<unk> they drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself at eight years old, the <unk> but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard about news.
A woman from 52 years of age was captured by having created a false account of Facebook from which they sent messages to <unk> <unk> for one year.
For one year a year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
What's huge -- though we <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
As an Patricia <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try to how our minds <unk> our minds, and once we are at the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what could be, can be <unk>
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to take advantage of your self and <unk> what you ever do, and it's under the ground floor -- it takes your name, empty your cow bank your cow accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all over the world, both as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in the time of envy.
We live in jealousy.
That is, we are good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when you're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I have always favorite <unk> <unk> <unk> the chief face of rat from <unk> <unk> which needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers it.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs its help, but it was <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the six <unk> once he <unk> <unk> <unk> to all of your solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And he says there's no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to raise your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I think this is very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to be treated as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they're on the same side.
Suddenly <unk> it allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if the <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a matter of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we expect that to happen, we remember that we have fiction for <unk>
Just fiction <unk> jealousy.
<unk> used to <unk> he invites them to the table.
And look at what the sweet was, the sweet <unk> the terrifying Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the very Marcel Marcel <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, in 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea <unk>
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but their presence in the gray gray, was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest decline in peace in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked 20,000 businesses, universities and government agencies.
<unk> people, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program took 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, which was used after the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why did we care?
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that it was because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words at Tufts University in <unk> they give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why do you <unk>
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And you might ask, why is why climbing the most <unk>
Thirty-five years ago, why would you fly on the <unk>
Why plays <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the Moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West in the Cold War.
At the time, the most strong emotion was the <unk> for transcendence of the powers of technology.
They were because it was a great thing to do it.
The landing on the Moon happened in a context of a long list of technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In half of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and just eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed like owning what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with a sail, but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew down to 40,000 miles / hour.
Since 1970, no human being has come back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the joyful optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> when we see that the problems that we imagined that technology would solve as to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure the cancer or to feed the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> of Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that they didn't belong to the <unk> tube of the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but it was completely sure that I would have seen colonies on Mars.
So that thing happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it over the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists had <unk> and they had enriched them with trivial toys -- things like <unk> and social networks or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> who have created companies less ambitious than <unk> from the years in which you <unk> 100,000 Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> in particular, the incentives that risk capitalists offer business business.
Silicon Valley says that the investment investment caused by the creation of ideas that are <unk> by the funding of problems -- or even even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It's mostly going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the risk capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they liked small investment, small investments that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble investing with the benefit of technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and development of development that is in the long term.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you look at it.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption came out of renewable energy sources like solar power, wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason it's completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want alternative energy sources that can compete at price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree on what politics and international treaties -- the developing energy development -- a significant increase in research and development, and some kind of control of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we will see an energy policy in the U.S. or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seem technological, they turn not to be.
We know for time that famines are result of failure in terms of food.
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are political crisis that affects <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like food or systems for storage and <unk> of food, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
And finally, big problems -- sometimes we have a solution because we don't understand the problem really.
The Nixon Nixon declared the war in 1971, but we soon found out that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant people to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years seem to have found effective and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and we need to do it, but these four elements have to be <unk> political leaders and the population must want to fix the problem: institutions need to be able to support the <unk> because we have to understand it.
<unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it meets with those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the difficult and the dangerous, and there is no popular science mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the Moon turned out to be simple.
It was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows we are not missing challenges.
Thank you very much.
OK, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> the ideas that have been about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a huge decline of trust, it's a very widespread faith.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third one is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task have been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a target and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea about it.
First of all, the <unk> why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to think that it may have fallen down in some activities or institutions that could have risen on others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can turn to the polls of view, and the opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the polls of opinion over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were going to be <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, keep the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still quite <unk> for nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average average of the street is almost exactly halfway in the road.
But it's this evidence for enough?
What the opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What you're looking at are attitudes attitudes that people are doing when they ask certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> on the <unk> teachers.
I would probably be able to ask, "What do you do what?"
And that would be a very promising answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some other no."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust in <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel like a certain kind of official <unk> or a kind of person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, to say I trust a certain teacher of elementary school that I know to give the kind of reading but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to hold a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real trust level -- because they try to make the good inherent trial in fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not that the goal that I have to do.
I will encourage you to have more confidence in what it's <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I am <unk> not to trust what is not reliable.
And I believe that those people who are saving their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> sitting there, or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say, he says, yes, that means that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about is making a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think in order to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in the raw materials -- and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be <unk>
But yes, on the contrary, they're not accountable, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but they didn't take them on them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that they will turn their own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I haven't yet <unk>
But that's what we are <unk> to find out before we trust.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've been trying to build accountability on accountability for all sorts of institutions, professional officials and others, who made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once he was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> than <unk> <unk>
And we found the same problem in our public life, and we have to figure out that the accountability of accountability which is meant to ensure that <unk> and testing <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like <unk> <unk> that we <unk> <unk> as we say.
You all know the similar examples.
It was all about the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we need to be worthy of trust and <unk> to the people that we are reliable and if you try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, your simple actions -- the <unk> what you don't do properly.
Third, the task.
You go to the task to rebuild trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should reconstruct trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, ultimately is signature because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't afford it, usually for all people, all the time.
But you also have to add <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That makes a day every day, everywhere, do the ordinary people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can give you a lot of explanations for explanations either.
I take them and get it back and get the money, or they change the color that I want.
That's great. I trust them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust, and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we're pointing is not really hard to <unk>
What people rely on is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worth trust.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers have come to us by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone increasingly and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a glass screen and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
So I started imagining how to <unk>
So first I created this tool that goes into digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen is transferring your physical body to pixels.
The designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool <unk>
But the two hands remain still outside the screen.
How do you get to the inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of your hands?
In the division of Science <unk> in Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
They put a transparent bombsight with camera cameras to detect the fingers and the face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, get inside of 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and files have a location in the real space, <unk> it's as easy as taking a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight lines or words with the virtual <unk> sensor that is down on every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands.
So in these examples, we are in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come to us?
We would have bought a lot of ourselves and returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a <unk> device, or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in the space, how we can make them physical so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical image.
This imam magnet is behaving as a pixel in 3D in space, which means that the computer as the users can move the object anywhere within this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And when we digitally installed the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back and reproduce it forever in the physical world.
You can teach them physically, physically and at the distance and the famous <unk> <unk> you can reproduce it as a physical reality of the physical reality that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of the planets, the physics, and, unlike employment books, this is a real, palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what is more fascinating to change the computer physics is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information will not just show us something but to start acting directly about ourselves as part of the physical world around us without us having to get rid of our world.
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you took that barrier, the only limit left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was excited to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes with all expenses costs.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become an engineering, like them.
After we survive the Islamic Revolution -- they believed strongly that there was only an effective way to <unk> a safe job and <unk> work.
matter if I would like it or not.
But my dream was to be an American mother singer in my mind.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start to <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could get to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio program.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends were <unk> but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
Let's go back to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> My <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in 1995, and what the first books that were doing here?
Those who were forbidden in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese <unk>
And it's not propaganda convenience.
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's one thing for another day.
But the fifth commandment of me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said, "It's so different, and so much better than I <unk>
And so it became my tool to get out of this cruel guilt trap and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also gave my habit of reading it.
It was a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning, this map seemed to me because this is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be at the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research camps such as comparative comparative and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that the comparative reading worked for research, why not do it in life in life.
So I started reading books from two.
They may be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and <unk>
For Buddha, they are all <unk> lust, fear and <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- rather than lost in translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that Chinese Chinese means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like I used to be powerless again.
Having a really broken dream -- this is really not compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
His most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams come from, where the passion, where happiness comes from.
Until a broken dream. I can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always are going to be <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I saw my first client in <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex came to the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw on the couch in my office and he took away the shoes and he told me that I wanted to talk about the problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a first client.
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could do it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> became easy for me to move your head while they were going to play the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> she said, Alex, and so I was looking at her, she was right.
You start to work later, you get home later, you have kids later, until death happens later.
<unk> like Alex and I had time to eat.
But shortly afterwards, my squad <unk> pushed me to Alex that I would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Sure, it's coming out with guys under their category, <unk> with a head <unk> but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe he <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work in marriage is just before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel a head after what they get <unk> but this didn't make the ones that the ones of Alex were a pause in their development.
And this made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized, that this benign <unk> was a real problem and it had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, families and future <unk> all over the place.
There are 50 million <unk> in America, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that no one comes to adulthood without passing before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove the dream of a <unk> I want to look at.
This is not just my opinion.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to the 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments <unk> that shape your life will have happened to be like 30 and <unk>
People from 40, not <unk>
This audience is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half Americans are married, they live or they are coming out with their future partner at the age of 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and it was <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something that you want to change yourself, now is the moment to change itself.
We know that the personality changes more times during its <unk> than any other moment of life and we know that the female fertility comes to its top to the 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the time for <unk> on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your daily life and common life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of <unk>
Researchers call <unk> an extended adolescence.
<unk> <unk> names <unk> to the <unk> as <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> what is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
And Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not right?
What do you think happens when you pat a <unk> on your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There's nothing.
They stole that person to that person the sense of urgency and its ambition and it's absolutely nothing.
And then every day, smart smart, like you or your kids and daughters get to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not good for me, but this relationship is not alone.
Or they say, "Everybody says that as I start a career before the 30, everything will be OK."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better resume day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My dates during the <unk> were like the game play.
They were all running, but then at some point around the 30, it switched on the music and everybody started sitting.
I didn't want to be the only one who was standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he was <unk>
Where are the <unk>
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme -- but it doesn't look like the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge pressure at the '30s, and so many of them start a career, pick a city, and have two or three children in a very short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there's research that starts to show you, which is a lot harder and <unk> to do all of the <unk>
<unk> crisis is not about buying red sporting cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
You realize you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and talk about their <unk> "What was he doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
By 25, Emma came to my office because I was in his own words, having an identity.
He said it would like to work in art or in the entertainment, but you can't still decide, so I spent the last few years working like <unk>
As I was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And in spite of living a few <unk> very difficult life had been even more difficult.
It's often in our <unk> but then she gets up to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma, he put his head on his legs and cried for almost the entire hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning with her lots of <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that goes after the words "In <unk> please call <unk>
I was about to <unk> when he saw me, and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who will take care of me if I give me <unk>
At that time, I had a lot of work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really was <unk>
He needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit in the time and the 1950s.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that all <unk> or a woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that he got rid of that identity and identity crisis and <unk> capital of identity.
For identity, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be after.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I do know this: capital of identity generates identity capital.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, that <unk> of that company that you want to try to try.
I'm not <unk> exploration, exploration -- I'm <unk> the exploration that I shouldn't count, which, by the way, is not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I told Emma that would explore jobs and make it count.
Second, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great for you to take you at the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds are limited by who you know when you know what you know about, how do you know how they think and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out of almost always comes from their closest circle.
Things come from what they're called weak links friends of friends of friends.
Yes, half the <unk> have bad work or not work.
But the other half won't, and the weak links are the way we <unk> this group.
Half of the jobs that have never been <unk> so knowing the boss of your neighbor is the way you get a work not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is going on.
On the last but not least, Emma believed you don't pick your family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as soon as he <unk> her family soon <unk> her family when he has a couple and form their own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think 30 is better enough to sit down than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now or tell you, now when everyone on Facebook start to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means to be so intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it to work or kill time with anyone who will be <unk>
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a roommate who was working on a museum art in another state.
This weak bond, he helped get a job there.
That job supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who she alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married man who <unk>
<unk> his new career, loves his new family, and I send a letter to say, "Now the spaces of aid aid spaces are not enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like planes coming out from from Los Angeles, coming somewhere in the west.
Just before the <unk> a slight fit on its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 to 25 and even the <unk> a good <unk> a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few or even at the next generation.
This is my idea that my idea of spreading all the <unk> who have heard of.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I have the privilege of saying to <unk> as Emma every day: -- <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get your identity, get their weak clouds, take their weak clouds, nominate your family.
Don't let you define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding your life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job in management management for a work that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach <unk> <unk> students in the public schools in New York.
And as any professor, I took tests and tests.
I give you tasks.
When work comes back, grades.
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance, they had no <unk> I.Q.
Some of my smartest kids were not going to be so good.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing that you need to learn in seventh grade, in seventh grade, are safe, <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years more of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure the best way we can measure anyway.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you're successful in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of scenarios -- and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the West Academy team <unk>
And we're trying to predict what we <unk> in the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> and we tried to predict what children would be as far as possible in the competition.
We studied professors who are working in very difficult neighborhoods -- what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and of <unk> who will be the most effective at improving the outcomes of learning from their <unk>
We teamed up with <unk> people, which of those marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it emerged a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look at physical health, and it's not the I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to his future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my questionnaires of determination and then waited for more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly older than even <unk> even when the <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the evidence -- even the safety of the evidence that they were in school.
So it's not just the West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little you know, the science of its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you develop <unk>
What should I do to teach kids a strong job work ethic.
How do we keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't keep forward with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the commonly determination is not related or it's even related to the action practices.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in the children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when you don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to do.
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions and we need to be <unk>
We need to measure whether they've been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start to start all back to the <unk>
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, and the shape of the Chinese character.
From that time, I was passionate about this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language I can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw every one of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic crisis.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read the <unk> traffic signals, menus to understand the basic idea of the web pages or newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as it might be possible until it's <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a ride.
<unk>
If the shape of the fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if they were shouting <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> from the form of called, but I like to believe it's in the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of gates on the old west.
I call these eight characters.
They are building blocks so that they create more characters.
One person.
If you walk back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, three are <unk>
If one person stretch your arms, this person is saying, <unk> that big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a drought, like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree, two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
You put a board on the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a speaker tree is quite an idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two together, it gets very hot.
Three percent together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and put it shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun goes out on the horizon.
One door. You put a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> touched there's somebody at home?
This person is coming out of a front door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're <unk>
So we've already gone through about 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical eight will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same as you learn a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun <unk> because Japan is east of China.
So a sun next to the origin, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where you go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind you that I have to stop talking to you and come down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad is the films I get to see.
I love sharing my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film took his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a bright dress and take a magic wand and take a word.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
Now we live and raising our children in a kind of cultural <unk> of a <unk> industrial show.
But the magician of Oz was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took rise to 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal <unk> and a <unk> boy <unk> a girl dresses like the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician of Oz is done today, the magician would say, <unk> -- you're the salvation of Oz like the prophecy.
They took magic shoes to defeat the military generated by the evil <unk> computer.
But that's not what happens.
Another one of the magician of Oz is that the most <unk> wise characters, and even <unk> are women.
I began to notice this when I did Star Wars my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
About three years.
He wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had been <unk>  So she slid the room in the room and was impressed as a parent, he was walking with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be issues of value, resilience and <unk>
I would have a sense that Luke had an army to support the government?
<unk> this with the magician of Oz in <unk>
How do you win Dorothy the film?
And to do good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow to to grow up, OK?
Why is there so much energy capital as a force in movies for our children, and so little on the road of bricks <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of the violence of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know for experience that Princess <unk> doesn't really provide the right framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the time of the first tour, I really expected them to appear because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is done, I have <unk>
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are lots of exceptions, and there are a lot of exceptions, from Disney <unk> to any of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though them, they are not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal work when they teach girls how they defend themselves against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show the kids how you defend ourselves from the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times continues to show up in classic after classic, each of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who train a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of it.
I recommend all of you. It's available in shops.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came out <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let it be <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies passes the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It hasn't really gotten off, and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a book book and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that I had had with a friend about the assessment of movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> In the film, there are more than a female character who has line?
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk about each other at some point in the film?
Their conversations are about something more than the boy as much as you like it?  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things else.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I really rarely see it in film that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality film, <unk>
Right? <unk> success from <unk> a sense of consensus about what a Hollywood Hollywood film is.
<unk> doesn't take the test of <unk>
And I don't think it <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen a lot of the film in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the crisis of the <unk>
We have many scenes of men who have profound conversations and painful and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great moment for one of the actors to look at a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go back in the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 most popular movies, how many of them believe that they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there's a larger number that this is going to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what it said, <unk>
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted in their life.
I don't think it's the <unk>
I don't think movies for children have something to do with that.
I also don't think that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is a lot of <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do you do it?
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then cash reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter as those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very startling statistic and we want to be <unk>
We have tools we have tools like <unk> <unk> and we hope that that <unk> but I have to ask yourself, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to parents.
I think we have to show our male children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of the masculinity is radically changing.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role that you care about home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite Star Wars did know what you <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to encourage them to reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories where I read my <unk> Go and struggle and more stories where he looked at her work to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician of <unk>
Thank you.
As a little girl, I was living in Maine, and one of the things that I was most liked was to look for a sea of the coast of Maine, because my parents told me that I would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I would give you to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me to <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love by the past and the <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I do with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to almost 1.3 miles of length next to the <unk>
And my starfish had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to do in a different way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see using the <unk>
This is a place located in the east Delta.
And the place, the naked eye seems to be brown but when we use infrared and process it using fake, suddenly the place looks like bright rose
What you're looking at are the actual chemical changes from the landscape of the building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we use satellite data to find an ancient city -- an old city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place stands in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art <unk> architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that were <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk>
This area is huge. It's about <unk> per mile.
We removed the Nile away, right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try and find out at random to look for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes <unk> and using baseball.
So we use data NASA to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area slightly elevated that you see inside the circle here, that we think it could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with scientists doing <unk> jobs -- you can see here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of the ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five feet down, below a thick thick layer -- we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> of the occupation of several hundred years that date out of the Middle East, exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry, the Middle Empire of the Earth, these are the stones that were <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation, which comes back from the Middle Empire.
We also have evidence from a elite jewelry, that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but we would encourage the place in a nearby future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire of the Ottoman Empire probably written by <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on land.
So according to it, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk>
Do the ideas happening really started in 1984 B.C. in a lost city, not for a lot of time and found from high school.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk>
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now <unk> a group of <unk> <unk>
They are racing in a bike bicycle race and they're in direction to their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide with the door of your house.
There are bicycles flying around -- wheels that go on the side, the rays of the wheels that end up in <unk> places, <unk> the threshold of the gate,
In the lobby, the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light, light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
It was from his <unk>
It's a horse that he talks about.
You can feel your blue <unk> tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you can go into the mouth.
You walk on one side and enter their living room.
Already in the room, and making peak of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with a little bit of clothes, dancing on its center center, singing <unk> -- One More <unk> More <unk>
Now you go to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a path of yellow <unk> and from the oven. They come to you with the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, <unk> to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar <unk> which is done every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> I guess, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages and different habits of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- looking at them just once.
<unk> the names of tens and tens of strangers.
I took up whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I thought, "This is <unk>
These people have to be the phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and he has one of the best <unk>
I said, <unk> when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I am not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who deals with this competition say they have normal memory.
We have been trained to perform these very old acts of memory using some old techniques invented by old years ago in Greece, the same techniques that we used to <unk> to memorize their addresses, and the medieval academics used to memorize the <unk> books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did you not hear about this <unk>
We were standing outside the hall of the competition, and <unk> who's a wonderful and brilliant English -- although a little bit <unk> said to me, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What?" No, why?
Because I would like Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of cards in live television on national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year, not just training my memory -- but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what its potential.
I met a bunch of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that he had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see how our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this guy.
This is Kim <unk> He based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went on one afternoon together in the public library of Salt Lake City, which was <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And by coming back, I read a number of treaties on the magazine written something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having disciplined and disciplined memory was not one thing as rare as it might look like today.
A long time ago, people investing in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they have changed.
We have changed the <unk> and I would say that we've changed a lot of changed as well.
As we almost don't have any need to remember, sometimes it seems that we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you're still passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory -- it's this unique competition of memory.
It's not really so <unk> there is <unk> like this.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College invited to a German champions of memory to the lab.
They wanted to know, will be that it has brains in some form of structural way, or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a battery in cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of the memory champions and the issues of control with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI machine, <unk> his brains while he took off numbers, faces and forms of snow -- they found that on the memory champions were going to get parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or seemed like <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> <unk> is driving as a armed career where each year comes into a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors have to get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there is 36 <unk> by <unk> <unk> who is about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and just he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> <unk> <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And while there is a huge amount of ways of remembering things in these competitions, absolutely all the techniques used to the end is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk>
It illustrates with a fancy paradox known as the paradox. <unk> <unk> says this: I say two people who remember the same word. I tell you that there's a man named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I'm asking you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I went back later, and I asked them to <unk> that word I told you a <unk>
What do you do?"
The person who was told that his name is <unk> is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said to her work is <unk>
Same word, different capacity of <unk> that's weird.
What about here?
Well, the name Baker, really means nothing to you. It doesn't have any relationship relationship.
With all the other memories they dance for their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use white <unk>
They have <unk> in your hands.
They have good when they come home to work.
Would you probably be <unk> some <unk>
And when we <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this date two thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
History says this: There was a poet called <unk> that I attended a <unk>
They had hired him as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you don't have a <unk> <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up, he pulled his poem from memory, and he <unk> and as soon as the hall was <unk> <unk>
Let's go all together.
But not only killed them, but they shattered the bodies out of <unk> <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So you could not be able to do it the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He was standing outside, he was standing out in the middle of the rubble, closed his eyes and realized that with his eyes of his mind, I could see where I was sitting every big time.
I took the family of the hand <unk> where his loved ones were on the rubble.
What <unk> picked up at that time is something that we all know about it or less <unk> and that is that no matter whether we're not good at remembering names, or phone numbers or instructions by word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If I told you that I was <unk> the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely to find them hard to do it.
But I would bet I would tell you who he was sitting on the horse solo brown in your lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember. The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the image, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you've been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to memory it in the same way that he would have made it <unk> if they had been invited to <unk>
What you could do is imagine that they're on the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous image and crazy image to help them remember that the first thing they want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and you can see the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then it comes in the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they will talk would be that strange journey that they did for one year, and have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how the speakers <unk> <unk> their speeches -- no word for a word that will be confused but typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people thought about the <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of space terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in your memory <unk>
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got off with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something extensive about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a boring event.
It's really like seeing a lot of people sitting on <unk> I mean, that the most exciting thing that happens is when someone was going down the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are incredible things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try and put myself in his place.
So I began to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I got to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was entertaining.
I would never have expected you to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just to train the memory.
What is actually about doing is more and more and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was really hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard training team.
It's a couple of <unk> and a pair of security covered with leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a competitor of memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could put it into a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve a good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize speeches and phone numbers, and on the phone lists, but actually this is not the point.
These are just <unk> <unk> that work.
Because they are based on pretty basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> from memory or memorize <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a gift <unk> but it's not the case.
Big memories are <unk>
At the most basic, we remember when we pay attention.
You know, when we focus deeply focused on it.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most is not <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
That's how things are doing <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what I <unk> the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, and I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our <unk> <unk> in <unk> or <unk> you don't pay attention to the human being in front of us, who is walking around our side, we're going to be so <unk> that we don't even stand up in process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to tell you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so we will just take a <unk> place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am of <unk> Jersey, I was about six years old, and I lived there at my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that would be able to be.
And then they all spent the <unk> so every time I was going from my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me, and every time I got <unk> and I would go back in a towel -- I all looked at me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> insecure and hated it.
He hated that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
Right, right?
Those feelings that I felt, that is the power of architecture because architecture is not about mathematics, and of these connections, but of these connections, emotional connections, that we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's no wonder that we feel like that, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture will determine us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you think about it in <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know you think about it because we built in a building built thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that architects use an emotional connection to the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection. We have used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums in the 19th century.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
You see, these stable <unk> <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time to be very complicated.
People who are <unk> <unk> and governments, always are afraid to innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public <unk> <unk> which was in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has this round thing, it has this round <unk> columns, red, which leaves <unk> what <unk> is trying to communicate with this <unk> the children, the values of ownership, the <unk>
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, went into another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use the media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come up, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> the architects that are constantly driving new technologies, new new solutions for the life forms of life.
We went on and we gave them a lot of the things that we get away from the people.
All black, this is <unk> you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we have no other choice.
We need to go on the other side and connect to them with those symbols.
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started to experiment with <unk> we go back to go ahead and go ahead and over and over and over and over and over and over and over the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, <unk> of the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, <unk>
Something really hard.
So we're approaching the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
I put the pendulum <unk> in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that I like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added a bake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we turned them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes are <unk> they won in boldness and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.

But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent time in commercial centers, and we moved to the slums, and there in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to the French, or to the Italian question.
And perhaps with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They are easy. They're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we can teach from other places.
I know very well, and you know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects feel frustrated and we started making the pendulum <unk> in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
We have the symbols called the <unk> we now have new design techniques of design, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that are being destroyed against other ways.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You're totally <unk>
Normally the pendulum <unk> back in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, this building.
It's <unk> by Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said it was one of those rare moments when <unk> and public critic in general, were completely according to a building.
The New York Times <unk> this construction of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao raised a 2,500 percent when the building ended up the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, in me, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first one.
But how is it possible that these wild and <unk> shape how you can become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media was around them and quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction in these ways.
The main mayor of the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new millennials went with other architects a star.
It went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few of these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to move with all of the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about how we use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
And shipping is <unk> they can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, we all are photographers of architecture, and the building is carried beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't take a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings before you know if the one I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find ourselves with buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two years, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen. It will happen. Because we're at the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of steel or the <unk> and it's the revolution revolution.
My theory is that when you apply it to the media, it starts to swing more and faster, to get in both extremes almost in <unk> and then effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional burden on something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a town called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked at exactly the product done, there were no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, and that first summer, when people began to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a communication medium, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that you made of the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians in <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet to look for <unk> <unk>
They were bombarded with examples of innovation, of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people from <unk> and tell you that there is no unique answer to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experiment.
Everything is different now.
architects are no longer those very mysterious creatures that use <unk> and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> audience, which doesn't take anything that I hadn't seen before.
<unk> you can listen, and you don't leave it by architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> from one style to another, of a movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different than the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn, it can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical imitation of red brick based on ideas of what it should be a stadium.
This means that some robots can build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings are driven to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking lot in <unk> Beach, Florida, you can also serve to make sports or for <unk> or even you can get married there at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming in the East <unk> in New York City, and raising half a million dollars of the homeless community around that cause, it's no longer a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> as <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what it matters is what we build.
architects know how to make more <unk> more intelligent and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to you.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings don't just reflect our society, but they shape the way to the most <unk> spaces in the local libraries the homes where we form our children, and the step <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned one year and started walking.
And it does this very typical way of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for her legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you want to do for the moment is <unk> in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of your friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and he made me think, when stopped doing this?
How is it that all of a sudden we're not comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for online, "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be liked and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time that's beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
Which his mom tells him and what his friends, or school colleagues say, don't know who to believe.
So a video of her himself, he publishes it on YouTube, and begs others who please leave a <unk> I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it's not even worth thinking about them.
We talked about a healthy and normal teenager who receives these answers on one of the stages of their most vulnerable life of life.
Thousands of people are posting movies like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking to you, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
We've never been so connected, in a continuous way, so young <unk>
As a mother said, "It's like there's a party in your room -- all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that goes from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, to be connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes they liked and the kinds of comments that they have.
There is no division of life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it is.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is real and what is manipulated digitally.
What is the most prominent thing in somebody's life in the front of what it's normal in a every day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> of the news news now.
<unk> <unk> <unk> keep <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who are <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture.
It's not hard to see what young young people.
But the kids are not immune to this.
Like the superheroes of sports stars and the singers who were born.
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be <unk> individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to devote more time and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects start to be hurt.
Six in 10 girls would rather not do something because they think they don't see beautiful enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings and how to taxpayers to society and the labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the classroom. They were going to participate in the classroom discussions because they don't want to call attention for their physical <unk>
One in five are not attending classes at all during the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think you see you good enough, you know, specifically if you don't think you're poor enough, you get a lower note to the average of your fellow who you don't care about that looks like.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the U.S. and China.
And it gives you regardless of what these young people are actually formed.
So, in order to be well clear, we are talking about how you see you not what you're like.
The low self-esteem on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk>
<unk> with little self-esteem <unk> they eat less fruits and vegetables, engaged in more diet not healthy than they can take them to a food disorder, and they can take them to a food disorder, and they can take them to a food disorder, and they can take them to a food disorder, and they can take them to a food disorder, and they can take them to a food
They have low self-esteem.
They are easier for the people around them and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all because of what they make decisions more <unk> like alcohol and drug consumption, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sexual activity, and without protection and <unk> damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the healthcare system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether they have a higher rates of <unk>
Fifty percent of women don't present to an interview interview in a day where they don't feel secure with the way you can see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that try?
<unk> this potential is for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key <unk> The first is that we have to instill in your own body.
We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images, and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of software available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow not only will have a positive impact on it as well.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas. The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects of the crucial things for anyone willing to provide a body self-esteem education that works.
An education is a fundamental way, but address this problem requires each of us to take charge on the issue and be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
Now challenging the current status of how women are seen and talked about our circles.
It's not good to talk to the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge people by what they are, not as you can see.
All of us can start by taking responsibility for the kind of images and the comments we published in our social networks.
We can <unk> people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you: When was it the last time you <unk> a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and companies to really change our culture, so that our children will grow to their children to grow the entire person, to valuing the <unk> the diversity, the <unk>
We need to put people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
So let's make a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones that go on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they are never aware of being the <unk> of being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who is in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
To his <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is two car seats -- what would it mean for her if it was liberated from that <unk> voice in his interior, which was going to give him not to have long legs -- more <unk> a smaller <unk> smaller <unk>
What would it mean for her if we <unk> this and we would give their potential to that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are getting to us all.
But let's turn to our children the truth.
It tells you that the way you see you are just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
They translate self-worth into the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, are becoming a safe change agents of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
The five of November 1990s, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed by the rabbi, <unk> <unk> the leader of the League Defense League <unk>
And I had initially experienced it as innocent as but as a prisoner of other charges in company in company started planning attacks at about 12 of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the headquarters for the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans would be fed by an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center could not escape you.
Later on, he would be convicted of their involvement in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a loving mother, elementary school elementary school elementary school elementary school.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very a few, including most Muslims will meet.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to have the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all human group, there is always a small fraction of people who become so <unk> to their convictions that they think that we have to use all the possible media for everybody to live as them.
A few months before the arrest he sat with me and explained that in the last weekends of week, he and some friends had been going to try to throw shot at Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I got <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to target about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet he shot gave the little orange light on the target and to surprise all of us, especially mine, all of me, all the goal broke out.
My uncle went back to the rest and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such as a kid.
And all of all, the comment took a lot of laughter, but just a few years later I understood what they thought to them as funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be committed to put a little bit with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground park of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved to me 20 times. That instability for my childhood wasn't allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone was already time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always me the new class of the class was often a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white. But it will be the new of the kind, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent at home reading books, watching television or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to say that <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
I was reminded by opera, judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences they put in the test of my mind was in the presidential election of 2000.
In a <unk> program where I was involved in the National National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group went into the subject of juvenile violence -- like I had been the victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I found out that one of the kids who had been done with us.
I took a number of days to go into the light, and I realized that there was no sign between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend before, and frankly I was very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all life had been made to believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer work in Bush in Bush, a park of <unk>
I found myself with people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All of life had been taught that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
I happened to have the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics I'd seen in life.
Having been a kid, I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat kind, exactly the way I wish to be treated.
For that feeling to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is about being homosexual but I know what it is to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then he came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me to be <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see that race of the people, religion or sexual orientation. You have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure that I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that an Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how my way of thinking, and she told me something that I hold in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with her eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough <unk> <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all of that hatred inside of it.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody else is going to try to lead to violence, you can hear my story and understand that there's a better way, that even though I would join me to this violent ideology I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced it in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to talk to these meaningless acts as rejection to my father's actions.
So with this <unk> I put up here as a proof that violence is not inherent to no religion or race, that children don't have to follow their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.
Right now, there's a film that is projects in their minds.
It's an incredible <unk> movie.
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and you see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your movie has smell, taste and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of childhood that project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice -- superimposed on your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
<unk> is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have a own internal film, you, you and you.
There's nothing to make them more directly.
At least, I know that I have a <unk>
I don't have any certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not mindful of this, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we just not just robots, what we get to do to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
The science, for nature, is objective
<unk> for nature, it's <unk>
Then you never have a science of consciousness.
Because for almost the entire 20th century, that vision.
<unk> psychology is studying behavioral behavior, neuroscience is studying the brain -- but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> as Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a blooming of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic job that Nancy <unk> did a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a <unk> science.
It's not a science of explanations science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of work in neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain do is and what they were <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
I don't offend the <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, not tackles the real mystery of this <unk> why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal <unk> movie.
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find an explanation.
The typical <unk> are all sorts of emerging behaviors, how do we operate the <unk> how the <unk> work -- how they <unk> are adapting and <unk> the living organisms -- they're all questions about the target target.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how to figure it out, how we talk about, how we talk to <unk> these are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why all behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works for a long time, I hit my head against a theory of consciousness in <unk> terms of physical terms that would work.
But at the end of the end, I got to the conclusion that it didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a string of wonderful explanations -- so we get used to this, physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology, explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think that consciousness, right now, is sort of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our worldview, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that to the beginning <unk> <unk> before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such hard problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the visual subjective film is a kind of kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain and the behaviors of the brain, and so it is studies all that needs to explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> <unk> based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is quite close to just denial that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as a building building, space, time and mass.
It involves fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties are not explaining in terms of nothing more basic than in terms of nothing about.
Instead, they are considered fundamental and from there it builds the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental list is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts in terms of fundamental concepts in terms of the fundamental concepts of space, and <unk> mass, so that he applied the basic laws of <unk> and applied the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws are <unk>
I think that's the situation we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas to <unk> space, time, <unk> mass, so for a question of logic, you have to play the list.
The most natural thing that would be <unk> consciousness itself as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens up the way to get it, scientifically.
So what we need is to study fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts space -- the time, the weather, the physical processes.
physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we could use them in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can use them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all of us, <unk> in mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, dogs, <unk> -- the mice, the flies, even the microbes by Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with anguish when I think about saying, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some element of a very crude feeling -- some very primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would somebody think something that <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's primal like space and time and mass, is natural to assume that it can also be universal.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum to nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most powerful and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that restore thinking with the physical process, is <unk> awareness with information.
Whenever there are information processing. There is consciousness.
<unk> complex <unk> as a human being, <unk>
<unk> simple information, simple awareness.
Something really exciting is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, a <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated in a system.
And it's supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a degree of integration of information, as quite significant, very significant, degree of consciousness, quite important.
But when you get to the worms.
The level of integration of information is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of zero.
It actually offers a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
Experiments and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using lots of equations, but we don't talk about the reality that underlies the bottom.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of the <unk>
From vision <unk> the equations of physics can be leaving as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not found out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there at the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision, has the potential to make our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think that all of this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask by consciousness in other systems like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information has a complicated complicated processing processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have a fairly serious ethical problems about the ethic of development of intelligent computers and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of collective <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group as the audience in a TED Talk, at this time we have a collective collective consciousness, an internal film for this full of TED, different from the inner films in each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question you must take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
Actually, I'm sure about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental idea, which is that in the second that it's universal.
Vision raises a lot of questions, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we're finally going to be discovered.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
It had a very normal profile -- a low-cost in education.
I went to school, I was obsessed with my friends, my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to help him for a community reward.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a problem without saying.
She didn't actually get <unk>  And they were right.
I went to school, I was good at school, I was good at school, I had a low-level profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the series of <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing to be considered a achievement if we take the disability outside the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school in <unk> high school just after about 20 minutes at the class 11 of <unk> studies, one guy raised her hand and said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
And I said, "What about <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When people in the wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
Usually in the classroom.
And it was then when I realized, this child had had experiences with people with disability as objects.
And we don't. And it's not the blame of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there to inspiring.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> to what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I fear <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we've lied to us in relation to disabilities.
Yes, you've been sold for us the lie that disability is <unk> A capital <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability makes you <unk>
It's not a bad thing and you can't make them remarkable.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You might have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this one: "Your excuse is <unk> In effect.
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
It may be you've seen one, the girl without drawing with a pencil held out of the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with <unk> carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk>
And I use the term porn term <unk> because I would take a group of people to the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we will recognize the severely disabled people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see and think, "Well, why is my life, it could be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person?
I have lost the number of times that I've been excited about strange <unk> to say that you think I'm a brave or a source of inspiration, and this will happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like if I got up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images will lead to the people with disability to people without disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things aren't just as bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is really difficult.
Let's get a few things.
But the things we did are not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was calling me to the so-called social model of disabled -- which tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
So the things I need to do, and I've learned to pull the best of his ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside of it.
They're just using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do it, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've been sold to us this lie that disability makes us exceptional for us.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> inspiration, and you think, "Oh God, you're not often inspired by anything?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to load your battery out of your mobile phone in the battery of the chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that the lie that has been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie because it's not true because of the social model of disabilities.
A lot of smiles in front of a stairs has never made it in a <unk>
Never.   <unk> to a television screen will not make the <unk> for the <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to actually live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> don't be considered not <unk> for being on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of the people who have disabilities that we are going to be empowered by getting out of the bed and remembering our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of disabled people, and I want to live in a world where a <unk> child in a high school school is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> user user <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think about what you do about it.
Thank you.
What do we have to do <unk> reality and soccer reality with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answering one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think of reality <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know -- because reality reality augmented our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows them to see what I see.
They will allow them to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will relate to your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and knowing what is run by the game of 160 to 160 percent blood hitting your ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds we were excited about trying to match everything out of it.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
I had a few videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the hull, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of <unk> because the idea of the emerging technology <unk> is a submarine up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible being <unk>
A moment. <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is to be <unk> in the football field from the <unk> perspective.
You may have noticed that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> of the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue eight, Blue Go! Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, be your favorite players and asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field of field <unk>
Or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that surely a lot of you know.
The <unk> Rift has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not cheap stuff.
And I'm going to show you the why, with this video.
Man: Oh, good.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a roller coaster of a <unk> <unk>
What will be the experience of a fan of <unk> a <unk> video crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before I run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan experience.
When I could be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball to the bottom of the network?  Or you would take a little bit of <unk> in <unk>
What will your experience experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe they <unk> the <unk> for adults.
But this is not yet <unk>
It's just virtual reality.
How do we achieve reality <unk>
<unk> reality <unk> when the <unk> <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So here is a quick refresher on technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore put a <unk> to her <unk> in the field to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, and more fast.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios on the <unk> of the <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming back to their group, and you see their next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you're in in front of you, you don't have to worry about <unk>
Or to memorize the strategy.
Just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate losing games.
If you lose parties <unk> as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality, it's not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your own way to play the party.
How do you do it?
Well, a very simple option would be having a camera in every corner of the stadium corner by having a view from the top of the people that is below.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something you're already working on.
And all of that information is send to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
evil will have the <unk>
This is <unk> at the good equipment.
So your computer team is going to be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to be <unk>
It's also to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the <unk>
They put the ball and <unk>
<unk> an open memory. All of a sudden, a <unk> on the left part of your bombsight -- you <unk> that a defense behind you is going to <unk> -- but the system of <unk> will be <unk>
It fits the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> that there is an open memory.
They took the <unk> but you get stuck.
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, though, the receptor sees in your bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and can modify the race.
<unk> <unk> takes the <unk> running and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have followed the move from each angle.
This is something that will create a massive emotion in the party.
I'm going to do lots of people looking at it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just as a bread and <unk> as our <unk>
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy among human beings, to show someone what is literally being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of revenue a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad it is their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay <unk> in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it's being <unk>
How much does it be for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of sticky notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, <unk> reality is coming.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face, <unk> as always, of us.
Thank you.
I recently showed myself after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years old, I got the southern end of the county of <unk> County, which includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is known for its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most effective places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> A head of boss who was able to build the bridge said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
suicide from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from his openness, more than 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so the fall from it gives you all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every free of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks down the bones, some of which makes life organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that don't, they normally lie in the water and then <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> this method of suicide will account for the death of the death that they are <unk>
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there's 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are for before you get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the dark point, it's very difficult to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to a officer experiencing his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who were given suicide, but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new official people.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him about 22 o'clock last year when you get a call from a possible suicide subject sitting on the fence near the center.
<unk> and when I arrived, I watched Jason talking to Jason talking to an official Golden <unk>
Jason had only 32 years old, and it had flown over here from New Jersey.
In fact, it had flown over here two times before New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour I was talking to <unk> I wondered if we knew about the history of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, her curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out of <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open up the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and she did.
This kind of smart guy in New Jersey had just taken their life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, he didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see how it was.
The parents of Jason had had the order.
<unk> damage about suicide affects a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or a friend or somebody loved it.
What would you say?
How do I say?
In my experience, there is not only to talk, but you need to listen.
Listening to understand.
You don't get <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like, because you probably don't know.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think somebody is <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask them the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end your life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of them may save the life and be the tipping point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there's nothing that you can do to the <unk> social isolation, and a lost of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you his letter.
She lost his son the 19 of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and he's with her permission and blessing I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I guess you're at the TED Conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I am still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike didn't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the 49 with his father in the 19th of January.
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and I was <unk> as disappeared as that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house, and they reported that his car car was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the evening of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting those who can be temporarily <unk> to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been wrong with no suffering from real mental illness.
It should not be so easy to end it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote to a phone call by a possible suicide guy on the sidewalk <unk> in the sidewalk near the north.
I took my <unk> on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> on the sidewalk.
When I looked at it, he crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the next hour and then I heard about Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
And Kevin decided to find that day back to that lane and give life another chance.
When Kevin came to it.
"This is a new new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he made <unk> and gave it to hope and life another <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
They stopped me talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the Kevin, and I have that card with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing <unk> the 11 of the 11th of March, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I heard Kevin when I was only six months old, completely unconscious of all those <unk> traits but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We give God for you.
<unk> with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end of it, I write, <unk> when I visited the General San Francisco Hospital that night, you <unk> as the patient.
I know I did have to do it.
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and active limb of society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story inspired others.
suicide is not just something that I've found in work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> with poison.
That act, despite the end of his own pain, the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think about hurt someone else.
They just want your own pain <unk>
Usually this is achieved only from three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls from suicide around the bridge.
From those incidents I've been directly involved in -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who spoke about an hour.
During that time, I was hand up at three times.
On the end, he looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And let's go back.
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few that have jumped on the bridge and lived and that they can talk about it, that one percent or two, most of those people have said that the second side side you end up the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or a bridge that we do, is something that all of us and each of us should be <unk> to do.
suicide can prevent.
There's help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you are, but in your inner mind, you know what you are, and a question you ask you, how do you tell you in that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way of all.
When I became a model model, I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner self.
And for complicated reasons, that I'm going to go over later, when I look at this picture, I think we did it, <unk> <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that, I'm just beginning.
We all shook our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the color of the skin or the beliefs that around us.
They're people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years old, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends -- my friends, my own still ignored my story.
I think this puzzle is called epiphany.
This is mine.
I recorded myself as <unk> because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, at my house, I was always wearing this shirt on the head.
And my mom was like, "Why do you wear that shirt on the <unk>
I said, "Mom, that's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, it's a bit more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never gave myself to share my story, not because I thought that being a bad thing, but why the world is all about the people of us who want to be <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, Dad and family who take me like I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition of <unk> culture celebrating the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came up to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me. This is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15, when I was still wearing man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the CEO of a wonderful <unk> competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she was responsible for the <unk> over the <unk> and his wardrobe <unk> and that night, I won in a bathroom and I got a third <unk> between over 40 candidate candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was by the Queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom.
I was hooked.
I told my mother, "Mom, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you <unk> the United States you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me that I would put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand at 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most sophisticated and safe surgery.
At that time in the U.S., it was necessary to be done before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name <unk> and the gender <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and being model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman, <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman from New York City who was living was living his truth, but he was able to end his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of the 20 of November we make a global <unk> by <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who <unk> and stood at injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth alone and just me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth, without shame, no fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no longer ever more <unk> than 20 percent <unk>
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
Will you you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> First of all, thank you for all my <unk>
I support my support network, my parents in particular, to my family, who itself is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they were called, and they told me that their parents couldn't take it, and I would take my mom and he said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked, other people don't. It's just identity identity -- that's what we are, right?
I mean, everybody was assigned to a gender of birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table the topic that sometimes that assignment, not block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and asking questions, and I hope that all my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice.
In many hunter-gatherer societies, and tribal societies, parents generally know about their children, but I'm one of the parents who are known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by education defending his rights in 2007. And when his efforts were brought in 2011, to the <unk> the <unk> National Prize for peace, became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if <unk> a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality and violence and exploitation.
You see, in Indian societies, right from the very beginning, when I was born, his birth would not be <unk>
It's not fine, nor for his father, not by his mother.
The neighborhood comes in, he gives her <unk> to mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother <unk> a lot to have a child.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when her third daughter, she feels guilty as a criminal.
Not just the previous mother, but the daughter, <unk> daughter <unk> when she grows, it suffers too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, she stays home and school admits of his siblings.
Up until the age of 12 years in a way, has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and you can move on the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it is 13 years old, you have to get out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the honor of his father and his brothers and his family and his family, and if you were able to put the code of that honor, and could even kill.
And it's interesting that this kind of code of honor, not only does it affect the life of a <unk> also affecting the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and their happiness of his sisters in the name of honor.
And there is one more norm of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl to be very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and embrace the decisions of his father and her mother and the nursing decisions even if you don't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with a old man has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the very young <unk> has to take it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson to her daughter and the same lesson of honor to their children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
She <unk> brothers and sisters, when he was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so much before I was born, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and I called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I put up a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years and a half years in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a little girl in a school?"
Yes, I should be <unk>
They can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in Eastern societies in tribal societies, it's a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means recognition and his name.
One point to school means that it's entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where you can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they were <unk> the form of suicide Canada, and was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen my names of my sisters.
That was the reason why I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and her daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
He encouraged me to go to different meetings.
And all these values, I've tried to lie on their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for <unk>
I showed my daughters, taught the students, forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson from the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all of political and social activities and social.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
Girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> girls <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but just a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, she got up and wake up on the right to education.
He wrote a blog for the BBC, blog was offered himself for New York Times documentaries and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They were <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate their campaign and on October nine.
It was one day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would love her to my wife "I must <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please not get you."
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play for the cause of truth, because of peace, and because of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words would be a lot to me, and I didn't ask questions again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe pains and a strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that was laid down the face of my wife.
But my daughter never was <unk>
I used to say, "I'm fine with my smile, and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to get good. Please don't <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we <unk>
And they took away brothers and sisters, have learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any 16-year-old girl.
<unk> when he did not finish his task.
They fight her brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What about special in my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
I did what I didn't do.
I didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> in the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineering experience.
And I want to tell you that recently I have joined the scientific group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> -- but all the work I'm talking about today about science science, I did before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you cling to an operation of brain.
Is it just as smart or not?
Don't be like that, you will be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what to take, from more than a dozen new chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mixes of chemicals, and try to <unk> them to stay alive.
Over once I have saved me.
But fortunately, I have a alma mater, so I decided that I decided to be able to try to get the dose of them, because there really isn't a clear map to say it in <unk>
I started to try and try and mix different mixes and I was surprised by looking at how little changes in the dose -- dramatically my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I made a dose and chemicals for a <unk> man, and I was surprised by watching my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I believed that it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several types, or maybe some versions.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a bit of <unk> to fix a problem that I had on the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't manage it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and about what they have to do, and since then I've been better with men.
What I was trying to do was to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so on, it was to recover my intelligence after the disease and my <unk> my creative thinking -- my flow of ideas.
So let's think of almost always in pictures, and that became my key reference point, how I can find these mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> looked at things in the same way.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how your mind works, to me, it's simple: for most of us, mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I got to find the right point and I have already lots of great mental <unk> and you really have a good good good and good mental <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images from my mind to the screen of the computer.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director was able to use his imagination just to drive the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could extract the music of her head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments done by two main groups in neuroscience.
And they were both using MRI technology, functional MRI, to represent the brain, you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person looking at an image.
The middle of the medium shows the brain scan of that same individual as you were to look at that same image.
The column on the right became <unk> the contents of the core column on the left, you see the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me tell you another experiment. This is from the <unk> lab, in Berkeley, California.
They were able to convert brain waves into visual <unk>
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, it showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube YouTube videos as they were turned to their brains to create a huge pool of brain reactions to video sequences.
Then I showed you a film with new images, new animals, and as much as a new <unk>
The computer, using just the brain data on the scan of it to show you what seemed that the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the computer <unk> and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew up <unk>
We're pretty close to this.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you can imagine that same image, you believed in the brain the same <unk>
This led to the brain scan systems available today, and its resolution increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you do it?
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is to open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer myself to that.
Many are proposing new techniques of projection by images, including me, <unk> with the recent results of the MRI -- first of us to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get higher resolution is with larger, but at this point, magnets more <unk> only offer little improvements in the resolution -- doesn't increase by thousands like we need.
I propose this idea: instead of bigger, let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements -- like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI was to make magnets really big, right?
And yet, most recent advances in <unk> of brilliant and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and FM receivers in the MRI systems.
In its time, instead of a magnetic field in which the magnetic field is using magnetic magnetic patterns <unk> to the frequencies of radio <unk>
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of the frequencies of scanning radio processing, we can increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split our growing knowledge into the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid, but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and maybe even neural neural activity.
Will we be able to put our ideas into a direct form to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is big.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Indeed, this same tool could lead to the cure disease and similar diseases.
We have a few more choices to open this door.
But anyway, choose one year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it's going to be much more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about this night about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the question of the gay me.
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet probably to say to some person for the first time she loves her or tell someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you're doing in life.
All about this is a hard conversation, and although our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet to be a universal thing.
It's <unk> and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side Side <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through various phases of the intensity of <unk> <unk> -- I didn't have my armpits to quote by quoting <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I will be the slope of my pants <unk> and I had <unk> her head -- I was usually a kid saying, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And he would appear to appear uncomfortable at the table.
I would take my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold, look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared and I was about to come up with the women's issues at the table.  I had the dates of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
And even an excerpt from the "Vagina Monologues" we <unk>
And so I took a lot of the way down and I went down the look and my back, a <unk> girl with a pink dress looking at me, which is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> a little girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
And so I took a breath again, again, I got <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something confusing.
I have the short hair like this one guy, and I looked at a clothing guy, but I am a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more of the kind of girl from a <unk> pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he says, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all right. Oh, <unk> You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest conversation that I ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and I know, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what color the walls.
You just know how one feels like living in a closet.
That's how my thesis is not different from yours or yours or yours.
I'm going to give you a hundred reasons why I came out of my closet -- was harder than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who have declared online banking is more difficult than he said it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is more difficult than to say to your son of five years you're going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop trying to categorize which is hard to respect about how difficult to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we have to just feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they may feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls made -- a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse, a <unk> dress and shoes.
It wasn't the militant lesbian prepared to fight for any <unk> <unk> who would leave in the coffee.
It was frozen by fear <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my grenade <unk> and the moving only one muscle is as scary ever ever done.
My family, my whole friends, strangers with whom I have spent my entire life trying to try not <unk> and now the world would turn around purpose.
I was burning the pages of an script that we've all been followed for so much time, but if you don't release that <unk> to kill you.
One of my most memorable launches was in my sister.
It was the first time that many people were invited to know that he was gay, and by doing my <unk> <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and eventually I came to one where my friends were friends of my parents, people I knew I knew years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women shouted, <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> once were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> You know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite TV program.
Our name is Will Will Grace <unk>
And you know who would be <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in hopes desperately to show her support, to make me know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirts at all.
And I had an opportunity at that time, like they have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for somebody, it's <unk>
If you're going to be real with somebody, you have to be prepared for how authentic you are.
It's like the hard conversations are still not going to be my strong point.
Ask anyone who I have ever met.
But I'm getting better, and I'm <unk> what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it means is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> the <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be, the others need to know we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> simply <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they're gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will keep the hope that that might change.
Don't give them a sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
They would never be bothered by that.
And some of them can be hurt by sure, <unk> by what they've done, but they're never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some will feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not their own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a dark answer to <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very much alone, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has seen an productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of if a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical to computer pioneers like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, we had a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let's take a step back.
Let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are from an alien race that you don't know about anything about Earth biology and the Earth of the Earth and the Earth of the Earth or the Earth's intelligence of the Earth, but they have amazing telescopes, and you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know about this, that you don't have any concept on Earth from the Earth, they would be forced to develop a physical theory that explains how, until some point in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that we understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines that <unk> I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be harnessed adjusted for the development of intelligence, and, in particular, to the development of universal states that will promote the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the <unk> planning process, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize future freedom for the end of doing complex tasks.
And so, taking all of these different issues together, and I was going to set up together, I asked all of these years ago, there's a mechanism underlying the intelligence we can extract from all these different <unk>
Is there just an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence I've ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is an assertion that intelligence is a <unk> F, that acts in order to maximize future freedom of action.
It's acting to maximize future freedom of action, or keeping the open choices, with a force that is capable of the potential future possible for the diversity of potential future -- Yeah, to an impending time <unk>
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
Music tries to maximize future freedom of action and maintaining the open choices.
And so if you realize this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the human <unk>
<unk> artificial intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should be based on more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence is a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually emerges directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize global entropy production in any system where you find in.
<unk> <unk> was able to spend multiple animal intelligence, play games, and even make money <unk> actions, all of that without any idea to have that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human <unk> here we see <unk> automatically <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave it a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability of balance will have applications for <unk> robotic technologies and human assistance.
This ability for tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate just pulling opposite extremes from a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can make a version of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see this successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where our friends are constantly getting constantly and keep with success the connected network.
This same network capacity of network also has applications in health care, and energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> setting up the routes of a fleet of boats, finding it success and using the Panama Canal to extend globally.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see they spontaneously found out to discover and run a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of negotiation and successfully negotiation on the assets under their exponentially.
This ability for risk risk will have broad applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of intelligent cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walk upright and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize your future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back at the beginning of the term of the robot, the <unk> piece, there was always the concept that if you have smart machines, there would be a <unk> election.
<unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion that goes into the other way.
It's not that the machines first become smart, and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the urge to take control of all future possible is a fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually emerge directly from control, rather than being upside down.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for targets <unk> from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to happen to the descendants of the descendants to help them build artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial intelligence, is this: intelligence must be view as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we have expanded our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting about other stars, which points that the Earth is only one of the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the dim visible intensity of stars when the planets go ahead of front of them, and they blocking a little bit of that light that's going to us.
The data picked out by Kepler shows the sizes of planets besides the distance that there are between them and their stem star.
In all together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth's planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their suns.
At its time, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this treasure trove of <unk> worlds our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The 2014 was the hottest record.
<unk> and sea ice they've been with us for millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused in a global scale have been <unk> our ability to disrupt its course.
But I am not a scientist of weather, nor a <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by stars, hoping to find places in the universe where we discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that look for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the search for life in the universe -- I can tell you that the more planets I look at the Earth, most of our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the last newly discovered, and the planets that we know better than our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and even though it's a little farther from the Sun, you can be considered a potentially livable world that is shown by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been <unk> in the past, and in part, that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> track its surface looking for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that the <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the atmosphere and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose your <unk>
Companies now offer not just about short space flights but also the <unk> possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images are <unk> you remember the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas and <unk> and compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the areas of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still left by <unk> places in comparison to Mars.
Even in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> land is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I'm worried that this excitement by the colonization of Mars, and other planets are going to get a huge and sad <unk> the implication and the belief that some of Mars is waiting for save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that is truly livable the Earth.
For a lot of that I like our exploration exploration I'm deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars is going to be there to bring humanity to humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the captain of the Titanic will be more late in the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for cave exploration, and civic preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of deciding and preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk>
It's just about home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain space spaces, in the hostile and <unk> areas of the land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with a <unk> experiment.
A lot of years ago, the Enrico physicist Fermi asked himself to realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider to be living between the stars, they lose the notion of what's important to protect the origin of the planets that we <unk> this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization <unk> will save us from ourselves, but planetary preservation and exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to respect the hostile environments of Mars for the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the easiest task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were at the table of the dining table, where I had <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows and all they were pretty off.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a lot of time to get it up, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend from Jeff to spend night because he had early flight to Europe next morning, and I had my passport and my <unk>
It was expensive, but safe not more expensive than a <unk> to a half late night, so I thought, well that despite the circumstances, I was pretty stuck.
I'm a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> Your heart rate increases the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thought.
And when I got to the counter counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started asking myself, if there was something I could do, systems that could put in his place, which would make bad things happen.
Or at least if bad things happen to be a total chance of a total catastrophe of it.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts did not happen.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who was the winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called a retrospective <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written from this a few years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come up and try to figure out what went wrong -- right?
In <unk> as a <unk> <unk> you can go ahead and try to find out all the things that might be wrong, then tries to figure out what can do to prevent things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, we will make a place for things that are pretty easily lose it.
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the things that are important -- where the fish are, where the fish are, which is where the fish, which are the <unk> trees and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows you to find them, find your nuts.
And if you ask if somebody actually did the experiment, they <unk> the sense of <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not as good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason to lose your car keys, goggles.
So at home -- a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, it was a particular ill.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they're <unk> with it all your things will always be there when you get them.
What about <unk>
Take with the cell phone -- a picture of your credit card license, I wouldn't buy yourself for email to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> it can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not at the best moment, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there are perhaps not more stressful than when you're facing a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our health care or a dear, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of medical decisions and in fact for the decision-making of financial decisions and social choices, any kind of decision that you need to take that would benefit from the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I have gotten the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, attack the heart, stroke brain.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I would like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today -- it's even likely you know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there is one question that you should do then, is a statistic you must ask about what most physicians don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number of you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or have surgery on any medical procedure before you help one person.
And you must think about what kind of statistic statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work.
And it's not a <unk> and whether it's about the scientists like me.
We haven't understood the <unk> mechanisms.
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs are just 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely <unk> which you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you help someone else's <unk>
300.
This according to the research of cynical researchers -- <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I would be exploring the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, or another event, <unk>
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 to lower my <unk>
Why don't it not, <unk> <unk> the recipe from all <unk>
But then you have to ask for more more statistic and it is, <unk> of the <unk> right?
To this particular drug, the side effects are produced in five percent of patients.
And those include <unk> <unk> <unk> of muscle pain.
But a moment.
remember, under stress doesn't think rather clearly.
So think about how we do this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug that will help you a drug.
I don't say you should not take the <unk>
I'm just saying that they must have this conversation with your physician.
The medical ethic is part of the principle of informed consent principle.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take your risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air by the value of the crash, but actually this number needs to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that is actually done in the older men of 50, <unk> of prostate for cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
This is 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> or erectile <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just going down a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of time before the questions that you can argue that we will understand the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because there is a lot of a choice, so many times, you want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot of pain towards the end?
These are the things that they talk and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face with a <unk> you don't need the <unk> system, or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very rapidly.
Unfortunately, one of the things that go through the window during those moments of stress is the logical thought, as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to focus on the future to this kind of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail every time.
The idea is to think about the future how that could be those <unk> to put systems in place that help to minimize the harm, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> on the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor settled on a combination of combination next to the door, with a key to the door door in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered and lots of messages I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see this organization as a process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely gentle.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree, there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can come to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, <unk> in addition to a little story.
The language of French signs came over the 1950s, and over the course of the time, it mixed with local signs, and it was developed in the language that we know as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and they taught me to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true at all.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a world of sounds, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following the rules, <unk> behaviors and <unk> <unk>
So how do you understand that?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned, for example ...
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
Don't do a lot of noise by eating the bag of potato <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, make sure not <unk> <unk>
All of this is what I call <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, the sound that's coming next.
From there, this picture.
<unk> by decide.
Let's go ahead and go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see the <unk> has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines contain sounds through the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, it is with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic apartment there.
Before this time, I'd worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, it was all <unk>
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
It's going to tell me more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it's not only experiences through the ears.
I can feel this kind of <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that had been taught in terms of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention I had.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
In the background of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was something of a listener.
And the sound is so powerful that you could go to me and my artistic job, or my art job, or I could be <unk>
I chose to get stuck.
There's a massive culture around the language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well and become my voice.
So I'm able to be able to be relevant in society today.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with many different performers <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking <unk> their voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan from a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that it could be <unk> in <unk> and not having any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, <unk> in the music world.
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot be capturing and express completely on the paper.
And the same thing can be said for a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all of the meaning as much as the signs of the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, to understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide it into a lot of different <unk>
If you <unk> a different parameter for every finger while the facial expression, the motion of the body, the speed, the shape of your hand and so, while the piano, the English is a linear language -- as if you put it on the same time.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the top 10 fingers in order to express a clear concept or idea in <unk>
If just a key game key, it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
And in <unk> when we use these different parameters, <unk> you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> on that."
This is the signal <unk> on that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and get it over and over again, it could become like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and you put it.
This is "All day."
If you get it, and it <unk> the speed, the visually looks like a piece of music.
All day long.
I feel that the same thing can be said to <unk> <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, on this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how the time is expressed in <unk> and how distance into body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer to and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is to spend a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> pace of <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically <unk> in <unk> same time."
Watch <unk> right right -- <unk> left hand.
We have <unk> through your head and your chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands on top.
Now we're going to do it both in your head as well as a little bit like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a <unk> is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages all over the world.
The second thing I'd like to show you is this one, please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please go back again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
So look at how three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and your chest. But you can see very different meanings here.
It's incredible to see how the <unk> live and thriving like the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, it automatically has no social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> no one that you have to hear to learn music.
<unk> is a rich trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I would like to try and open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would tell me, "Can you get everything, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a innocence or a bubble bubble bubble of ignorance because adults would lie to us from the awful truth.
And when I got older, I learned that adults were also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean others.
The time I country, I'm now adult and teach and invention in <unk> Hong Kong in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait so much for my students to walk around the beach.
So as good citizens, cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but today more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we have been coming out with these big vessels and networks, to collect these little bits of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge <unk>
So along with my students, with ages of six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
So we started building this <unk> work <unk> so that the very kids can also participate.
And I'm going to tell you, the kids who manipulate electrical tools are cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every child and try to figure it into something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the children would get a lot of with robots.
And then we created very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast.
And we turned it into the lights and web cameras, and <unk> it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and through the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measuring the size of every single <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone will get it to be even more <unk>
The cool thing on this project is that the students saw a local problem, and they are <unk> they're trying to <unk>
I'm able to research my problem <unk> but my students in Hong Kong are a lot of children who are very well.
You see the news, you see the Internet, and they get stuck with this image: with this view.
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning up a oil spill, only using hands, in <unk> the world's largest <unk>
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which they put down the water where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown and the oil and the oil are also brown color, and when everything is <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can spread through all kinds of chemicals that produce different spectra which can help to identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor, and we send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or looking at a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I'm going to ask a problem to <unk> I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and probably remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroyed a number of cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant.
And today, according to the reports an average of 300 tons are still filtering from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution <unk>
If we go to the West Coast, we can measure radiation <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast and most of the time, it has to be safe is blue.
Well, the reality is a little more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and research independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the children.
Of course you don't have the <unk> the parents don't know.
But every night I went to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks in it.
It might seem like they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with <unk> all their life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and talk about what we were going to do afterwards, <unk> <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigments to represent data in real time from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So with this we were able to notice that the radioactive dust is taken from the top of the mountain towards the <unk> system, and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an estimate <unk>
But based on this we organized an civil expedition, the closest to nuclear power to date.
We get to a 1.5 miles of the nuclear power and the <unk> help of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> device as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun to try to solve problems.
I wonder whether we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and turn it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, of optical fibers, you can basically build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where dreams of children can become reality with the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk>
For example.
Or we can help in mobility in the age of age, transforming their standard wheelchair in new <unk> vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and <unk> are terrible, terrible ones, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We can't afford to protect children from horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, citizen scientists, creators <unk> we have to prepare the next generation to be cared for the environment and people, and so they can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically <unk>
One is made of thousands of steel pieces of steel, the other one silk silk.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other thing I thought.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the seduction marble he saw a figure that fights for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool for Michelangelo.
But the living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we take all the information out for every cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of the design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world that is made in the place, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects to think about their objects as <unk> of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with small <unk>
One acts primarily as a filter, the other mainly like barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no place, there is no <unk>
It's a system that changes its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a broken screen, which represents my view of the world that is twice as much of every designer and architect in working on the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the gene, between the machine, and the organism between the assembly and growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analytics and synthesis, it shows in the two screens after me.
My job at its simplest level, it's about bringing these two visions of the world, moving away from the assembly and coming up to growth.
You probably wonder, why now?
Why wasn't it possible for 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special time in history, a weird moment, where you have four disciplines that offer designers access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I thought.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, and tools and tools through scale, a big scale, like this robotic arm with a 24-hour scope of a force that might not be very far to print out buildings and <unk> and <unk> made from genetically engineered <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture and has created a screen where every aperture is <unk> just to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion bar of Paris with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made of a single piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with printing printing printing -- we printed this layer and 3D <unk> no seams between cells. I'll show more objects like that.
This helmet combines <unk> materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a brain scanner that is <unk>
Which designers have access to this high resolution, and the <unk> instruments allow to design products that <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair, a chair for structural and so comfortable and also it absorbs sound.
The <unk> writer, my collaborator, went back to nature for <unk> and by designing this <unk> surface pattern, it becomes <unk>
They put up this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, we <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, as in nature, changes its functionality not by addition to another material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk>
But it's nature's nature.
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't raised in a religious home, but when my grandmother was young, my grandmother told me stories from the Guttenberg Bible, and one of them came to me, and it came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> <unk>
For that first <unk> tree there would be no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the Earth made trees grow trees with branches, <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world.
I often ask myself, "What would be the design if objects were made of a single piece?
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we looked for the material that is the kind of material in the <unk> tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second largest <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we can tune your properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  <unk> a bunch of husks of <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> political concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures in order to build a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material over the march and create these structures made of one extra three extra material, 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are ready, you dry it in order to find a natural form in contact with air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to hold <unk> <unk> that first time on the planet makes 3.5 billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT -- the bacteria designed genetically to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that are doing their transition without the problems of molecular <unk> and if it extends even more, on windows.
A <unk> <unk> tree.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure made of <unk> of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects designed for <unk> jobs in the sea, life <unk> and placed on the ground, help grow a tree.
The fit for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we must master bacteria and control their flow.
Just like the <unk> table, we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk>
And I like to think of synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- new diseases -- new biological channels.
This field is called <unk>
We have our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothing -- you know, two <unk> <unk>
The first one is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the ponds of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
It makes the light in sugar, the other consumes sugar and causes useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
To hold these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like to the tract tract that will help you <unk> these bacteria and that they will turn their function into the way.
So we began to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material as well as <unk>
If we wanted to get more <unk> they will be more transparent <unk>
This system <unk> <unk> when it comes from one end to another, it spans 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our <unk> <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are state-of-the-art creatures -- only half is <unk>
What if design would get the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we were able to create personal <unk> that we put our skin, <unk> the tissue hurt and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way to edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer prints material out.
You also know that nature doesn't do that way.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture within which it is <unk>
The manufacturing is not <unk> about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of not two materials, but two different proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, which is those fibers in each other.
And this is happening across scales.
The silk worm goes into the environment, creates a <unk> structure and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a <unk> <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualizing the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we figured out that they <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk>
So we started designing different parts of different countries, and we've discovered that the shape -- what the shape of the <unk> structure was transmitted directly by the environment.
They often put the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk <unk> and it uses the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we could shape <unk> silk without just boiling <unk>
It was <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot <unk> and we put it on our site.
We knew that silk worms were <unk> into more dark areas and <unk> so we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and the warmth, to make silk worms over the structure.
We were ready for <unk>
<unk> <unk> worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to hide with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and while <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the big integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> silk silk on <unk> silk, which is all this pavilion that is its integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> silk <unk> <unk> miles away.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the road <unk>
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to give life to product and buildings around us to form a ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two visions in the world.
What drives us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, that brings us from a very inspired design in nature to an inspired nature of design, which demands us, for the first time, that we do charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked them, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they first asked this?
You can compare your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask yourself, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had a <unk>
In the school I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and created websites and also playing the guitar, in a band punk called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, comes to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I was struck by something else, something completely different, and I'm going to focus on it, and I let myself absorb and I feel <unk> I have found it <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to let it go.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern made me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all of my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason why caused a lot of anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there would be something wrong with this, and something bad at me because of nothing.
I was worried about commitment, or <unk> or <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to have asked you then.
And we can tell themselves, where do you learn to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I will tell you where they <unk> they learned about culture.
Do you ask yourself, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years old.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they would be at that age.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in kids like, <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question is done to us again and again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to graduate school students are going to pick up in college.
And at some point, what do you want to be about <unk>
It's going to be the cute exercise before it takes away the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by kids to dream with what they might be, it's not inspired to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does the opposite, because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't respond with 20 different things, even though adults are perhaps <unk> and say, "Oh, what's cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative director.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each one of us has something to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and devote your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up with curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone in that frame.
And so you can feel it.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel that there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
It's a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a breath for the way to say.
Could it help if you divide up in three quarters of the potential and <unk>
You can also use some other terms that we have the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was that I was fine in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
You want any term you like or <unk> your own.
I think it seems like a kind of adapting to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or <unk> you must win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> had a shared interests in cartography, visualization data visualization and <unk> mathematics and design.
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
By <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for her <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
That's where new ideas come from.
And <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower, <unk> is very fast.
When we were <unk> we are <unk>
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> because we have been <unk> by the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and coming out of our comfort areas.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we have -- so we rarely start zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> in time and writer, independent time.
As a child pianist had an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before he became a writer, I was <unk> it was financial <unk>
He had to learn the most thin sales mechanics when he was starting their practices, and this ability helps to write compelling the editors editors.
It rarely is a loss of time to go to what you would give them to you, even if you end it to the end of it.
Is it possible to apply that knowledge into a completely different field in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability. That is the ability to transition into anything that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes a director of videos, a lot of web designer -- sometimes a bad table sometimes a teacher, and, sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes good work.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> magazine defined adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are individuals and organizations that can be able to deal with the needs of the market needs to be really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could lose if you're a pressure to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, we have <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to cope with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> of my belly knowing because they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams are made up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put on ideas, and <unk> offers a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we all need to design lives and careers that are dealing with how we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a large part are told to be more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said this, if there is one thing that you will take away from this talk, I hope that this is this: <unk> with internal farming, whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist then, <unk> all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,   I say, <unk> with their lots of passions.
Keep his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring takes us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world will be <unk>
Thank you.
In the year <unk> a woman named <unk> brought her to a psychiatric psychiatric problem.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until unfortunately, he passed away in <unk>
After his death, she did a <unk> and they found strange plates, and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you were living there today, we could not give her more help than she <unk> he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
Since <unk> medicine has come a lot.
They've been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> lots of treatments for cancer, doctors for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it's been involved in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it'll affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you wait to live to 85 years or more, the possibility of getting Alzheimer's disease is almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that your years is coming up with Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or want with Alzheimer's disease.
Already in America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and their costs cost a rise of five times by 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's may be one of the greatest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little for <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't afford to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less about Alzheimer's than the other disease that we have invested less time and money on the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than in Alzheimer's despite the fact that we have more Alzheimer's disease and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but everybody else, Alzheimer's world is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of us, even though scientists, normal, Alzheimer's of aging.
We think that will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But only you have to look at a picture of a healthy human brain, compared to a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe loss of memory and mental abilities harm to the brain caused by Alzheimer's rate, significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plate and strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up like an origami.
There are places on the paper that are <unk>
And when it gets folds out, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots are <unk>
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and identifying what we step block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
I could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step that we can do, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of the wires have been reduced to the wires and waited the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've been able to identify a critical step in the process. Now you're testing a new kind of drugs that blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it.
Let's look at some videos of what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move with normal.
These maggots, on the other hand, have molecules of protein that <unk> each other within them, as in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms in early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just an initial result, but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there are real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to convince us that Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and if we <unk> we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have topped more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry, about scientists and <unk>
That was essential to move through HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, are often too <unk> to get out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Health is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
<unk> this article in the New York Times column, in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, to do this.
The paper is about a psychological study that was designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience of testing myself one night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers are <unk> to build 36 more and more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions here.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, which would be?
Number one: When did it be the last time you would have someone else's <unk>
And let's go back.
<unk> that are getting more personal and more personal.
Number three: <unk> actually <unk> me to your partner what you like to do or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say anybody you've ever met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a very detail called me attention, the gadget two of two of the participants had married six months later and invited all the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the occasion to test this study, with someone who I knew not particularly too well, I didn't expect to do it.
But I thought it was a good story, and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the neocortical Love a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably ask -- they keep together yet.
And the reason I think you think about this is because I've been doing this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
One week before I was published the article was really nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had taught me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entrance can come to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would reach probably some thousands of view.
And that came a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was published on Friday at night, and on Saturday, this happened in my blog.
And Sunday, the Sunday, I had already called the "Today Show and "Good <unk>
In one month, the article received over eight million views, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust by writing with all of the <unk> experiences -- but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  and that people all over the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or writing, what they did every day for weeks, they were doing the same question: still ask the same question: still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase, <unk> <unk>
And a number of messages came up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers like this.
I was interviewed on the radio and <unk>
I even gave a talk, and a woman screamed up to the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship to an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk> their own.
In fact, the New York Times published an article for San <unk> which included the experiences of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first drive to all this attention was to be very close to my own relationship.
I said not every request that we both did a public emergence together.
I went on TV TV interviews, and I <unk> orders for pictures of two of us.
I think I was afraid of becoming the icons of the <unk> process, a range that I didn't feel at absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know if the study worked -- they wanted to know if really <unk> I mean, if I was able to produce love -- not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question that I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months old, and I felt, mostly that people made the wrong question.
How do you know if you go together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the investigator was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for <unk> <unk> between college students, using what they were doing, called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants had closer felt closer after doing that, several studies, so they also used the infectious protocol as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it among members of the police and the community, and they've used it between people of <unk> political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, that combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts college, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, you want to say that you get rid of the person with whom you <unk>
Well he did a break.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that I know managed to get better better better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult separation that was going on.
I'd had that relationship since he had 20, what was mostly my adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how to live without it.
So I turned to science.
What I could find was the whole thing I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just did research for the book that I was writing but in retrospect, it seems to really be <unk>
I thought that if I was excited about the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel like then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confident to demand what I go.
But I can also see myself more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably to demand me to me.
What I'm looking for about love is an assurance -- not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but that will remain <unk> endlessly by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people wondered when they wanted to know if they were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way for some way to mitigate some of the risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because in love to make us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story says, still together?
And his content with an answer or No.
So more than a question, I think we ask more difficult, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who not?
How will they stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live to <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a closer conversation about what to love someone.
So, if you want the brief version of my relationship, it's a <unk> a year ago, a known one, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article, love didn't happen.
<unk> in love because we take the choice to be.
And I kind of <unk> reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything that I was supposed for.
It didn't look like how many times we would have to make that decision, and how sometimes I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he was going to choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded 36 questions, to have chosen to love somebody as generous, kind of fun and fun and having expressed that choice in the largest day in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what I'm going to do, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a few lesbian in full mountain and I felt like a <unk> of the forest.
It really affected me in New York City -- something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and <unk> a dollar bill and a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some weird <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has <unk> because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from a tour and <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> I was Agnes Martin, I covered the resin and a bee remained <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and he is <unk> to them, so I added a little bit more resin on the canvas, thinking he could <unk>
Instead, it happened to the opposite of some way it seemed to grow up size, as if it was to be able to <unk> the text with a <unk>
So I did build more boxes.
This time, I started to add some electronic elements, frogs, strange of strange bottles that was finding out the street, all I could find out, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> drawing just like it is about a body on the crime scene.
And I took the objects and I created my own taxonomy of individuals that were <unk>
First of all, you will be able to make an idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was cool.
At some point I got interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings within the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was hooked.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass, similar to the drawing on a window, then on another window and another window window, and he had all these windows together forming a three-dimensional composition of three-dimensional composition together.
And this really worked -- and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big -- I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by a big measure in "The garden of the <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 thousand pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double a face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, she's Jesus and <unk>
There is a cave where all of these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from <unk> to this <unk> mesh of <unk> where they <unk>
This is where the creatures with animals are headed by <unk> <unk> to kill mass <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well on the ocean.
But anyway, also sort of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and he spits up oil in a hand while the other hand gets out clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like being <unk> that holds Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit a story.
That's the hand in which I <unk>
And then, when you go to the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it spits out clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> strip of a snake tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, its tail turn on fire by a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> eye <unk> made of terrorist cards.
You've been <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
Very <unk> to your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each acts as a kind of archive in a way of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the same time.
They're like cells, they come together, they <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years old.
Each one is basically a microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds with a human being trapped inside.
This is a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> there is the chest, you can get rid of the <unk>
I'm going to see you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it covers your penis or <unk> or whatever it has to have, a kind of thing <unk>
It's a quick job of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a <unk> body in half.
This has two heads, and they're communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and enter the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest scene inside the cavity <unk>
Can you care?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, and it's a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physical, a painter, a painter, a musician, a musician, a radio <unk> a <unk> a school, a <unk> arm, an editorial arm that fills the whole content we do in the world and a garden.
It takes the box and all the people inside each other, with others like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box in which it's living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, from borders, of religion, it doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweet and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill to have effect against the pain, first of your stomach, the guts and other organs.
And I'm going to take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug <unk> effect on your body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When they take <unk> drugs, these serve to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and then increase the tumor cells.
But they are also known by its side effects that are going to be seen in its negative majority because in the time that it takes you to get to the current current -- you could get <unk> and worse still for the time that it takes to make your destiny, which is where it's more important, in the HIV tradition.
These are regions of the body like the lymph ones, the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it's not going to be easily in the blood stream of the patients that will spread to the regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the treatment of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment for life run by <unk>
One day, I felt and I thought, "You know, <unk> to make the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for the care of wounds and surgery surgery -- can be used for anything they want, including transport for drugs.
In fact, we are already using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes, that open and close -- almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
You better say, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little bit of a potent laser ray of the living cell membrane living in HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even know it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or on <unk> plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, you go to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that goes through the drug, then release it directly into the crime of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the full eradication of HIV in the body.
Yes. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all the research <unk> in our case, a laser treatment with it.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups -- not <unk> organizations that are armed with terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
They do what these groups do when they're not shooting at <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these <unk> agents and study ways to encourage the transition of violent engagement to violent confrontation, not violent.
I do work work in the world of politics and library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
I used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and non-state actors.
For example, of the <unk> agreements of peace <unk> between 1975 and 2011, <unk> was signed between a state and an actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even have to be <unk> or <unk> in any very successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but no one looks at what they do when they don't exist.
The armed struggle and political policies are not <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
Since its creation in the 1980s, he has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> met for his suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> in Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking enough.
They have a complex machinery of communication stations, cable channels, websites websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups also invest in a complex fundraising fundraising fundraising but through business -- for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, to increase their strength, to get better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools and run hospitals, they run professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups also try to conquer the population by offering something that the state of the state is no longer and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan ripped through the war, and even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also figure out the efforts of these groups for providing safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an unprecedented price for the population.
But in general, they provide social services that means filling an empty gap.
For example, the victory election of 2006, from Palestinian Hamas can't understand the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario in the West, when we look at groups -- we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill <unk> gaps by government, and they emerge as armed and political groups, participate in violent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and the sophisticated ones are these organizations, less we can <unk> it as something to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
They were part of a territory running all their functions, collect the trash system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states of nations without state and hybrids and the weakest the ones are states, as in the Middle East today, and they fill that gap.
This is important to governments, because to counter to these groups will have to invest more in no military tools.
<unk> that vacuum emptiness has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and to put the peace.
If we understand the groups better -- we'll better understand what incentives offer to foster the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, the military power can win some battles, but we're not going to be peace and stability.
To achieve these targets we need to have long-term investments to fill that emptiness gap.
Thank you.
I'm a rock as a woman and a feminist.
My views on gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid they accept openly the label would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a <unk> but pretty bad.
And that's why I was a bad feminist feminist.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in the interviews, people started to call me <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, he had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> as though that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the people in the <unk> that might be a feminist.
It's going to be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a word <unk>
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which calls too much with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's like or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and besides, proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
I would take the same wages for the same job.
We have a right to travel around the world as <unk> free or violence.
We have a right to use it very easy and accessible to contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to the respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to tell our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, skills and <unk>
We have to have in account these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is not anything.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear. I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I listen to music and <unk>
But the letter <unk> women and offends me, the classic <unk> <unk> of the Yin yang <unk> is amazing.
<unk> actually with your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you <unk> the <unk>
Think about it.
You would say, poetry, right?
I'm totally overwhelmed by my musical ears.
I firmly believe in the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion magazines and things nice stuff.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic <unk> from <unk> fairy <unk>
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of her husband, it's her choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their children, I remember that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is rooted in a way that makes women economically vulnerable when they behave.
We have this problem.
<unk> the conventional <unk> which has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the color of color, the workers, gay workers, and <unk> for women and high school <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist feminist thing.
It also happens to the following: As <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put out of <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we hope perfection.
When we <unk> the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I have a <unk> I think of that <unk> before I try to put myself up there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> by fear that means that <unk> fear not to be able to meet the <unk>
Let's take for example to <unk> or like I call it. The <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist feminist box.
In <unk> Music <unk> from 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the <unk> word <unk>
It was a <unk> show to this star of the poop embracing openly feminism and how to know women and young men that will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, critical critics began endless arguments if they were <unk> it was not just a feminist.
So let's tell her feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection from the <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We go far beyond the sane criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism from any woman, <unk> until it is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or rather, a feminism feminism is the baseline.
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to the day, going to be a little more <unk>
If I listen to music -- I am creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy providing a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change affecting effectively their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does his music be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions are justify that it makes it harder for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
They are two <unk> <unk> and shiny and so <unk> I want to grow in a world.
Where they were excited about the strong creatures they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice would be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program deals with sexual violence against women as sports, as sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change radio radio when we listen to songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to film in the other part when movies don't treat women more than how they were <unk>
We can stop supporting corporate sports sports where athletes treat their peers as <unk>
In any case, men, especially poor white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in your journal, and participate in your project, or work with you, until that they don't have enough of women, so much to participate in how to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also adapt to being included until more and more of us are reluctant to overcome barriers to make decision-making barriers to make decision-making barriers to make decision-making barriers to make decision-making barriers to make decision-making barriers to make decision-making barriers to make decision-making barriers to make decision-making barriers to make decision-making barriers to
Because we are not officially <unk> Without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and hope that our decisions come to the top, to the people in the power of directors and movie producers and music, <unk> <unk> people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a lasting change and significant change.
We can also say with bravery our feminism, -- well, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you about everything, because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to cope with what happened.
A few kids told me, when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all I didn't think about that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was focusing on a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and they understood what it meant to live in this world if you have brown skin.
I read the words of the women that showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned how to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also discovered that if I was a little brave -- another woman could hear me and see that none of us is the world that the world tries to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to do anything.
And in the other, I argue the unfortunate reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad geek, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way of thinking, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same.
I hope that we can all be a bit courageous, when you need a little bit of <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> to have visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border of Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be fatal to a child with a <unk> immune system is one of the toughest diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be <unk> autism.
But a moment, it wasn't the article that sparked the argument about autism and the <unk> vaccines that have been <unk> by being an <unk> fraud by the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that the vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise of autism in the time.
For the most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about her believed to develop their whole life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence of prevalence continued stable just three or four children for every <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, numbers started <unk>
<unk> fundraising fundraising fundraising team to refer to autism as an epidemic as if you could <unk> another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If it's not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people to the Centers for Disease Control -- what is going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> of diagnostic <unk> and a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that type of language doesn't <unk> the fears of a young mother who looked at the face of his son of two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be asked by what they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to find the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is less than to do with slow and <unk> progress of the science that with the seductive power of storytelling.
For the most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism than had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we have to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns <unk> Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> and private worlds -- people around their own parents.
They could amuse them for hours by waving the hands before their faces, but they were from from the panic by <unk> as when you didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of treated patients in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By the years of 1950, as the main authority of the world on the subject, declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as long as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the <unk> criteria for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, I will give that diagnosis to children with seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he had turned to nine percent of each 10 children to her office to become autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of their theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child is caused by cold parents, <unk>
These kids, he said, they've kept careful in a refrigerator that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that they were clustering in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before the two years ago.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he had properly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills affirming things like the kids were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents kept desperate to win.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to the institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
<unk> wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a cognitive psychologist, and I thought the theory of <unk> mothers -- was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John were warm and <unk> and they had an autistic autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a child as no person without special education, without special education, without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
In order to stand for the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, and their colleague were Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched an prevalence of prevalence of autism in the general population.
He took a suburb from London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse diverse.
Some children couldn't speak at all, while others were going to lie in their fascination with astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
In other ways, these kids didn't fit in <unk> and <unk> as he said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At the beginning, they were lost to try to make sense of their data.
How did nobody realize these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in <unk> in <unk> the next year to the <unk> article, and then he was <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article from the competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> he talked German, and he did it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a boarding school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with the music classes with music, and the kids followed their games on Sunday, the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as a disabled disability of life that required <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, as their little teachers, the little teachers, and he went to help in the development of education methods that were particularly fitting for them.
<unk> has seen autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disabilities.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they've always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> <unk> in pop culture like the awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say that for success in science and art, a hint of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong with autism as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and early 1990s, their changes in <unk> -- by using the limited model of <unk> by a broad and <unk> model.
These changes don't fell in <unk>
<unk> when I was <unk> and Judith worked in <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I went out -- <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and the recognition of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and the parents of everybody knew what autism was.
At the same time, they were introduced to the first easy clinical trials to use autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a perfect storm a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> as they predicted <unk> and <unk> actually expected out that it was out there, so that people with autism and their families were finally providing the support and services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame to <unk> by increasing <unk> and a simple, powerful, credible story as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the heart of prevention that one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, is the same, the autistic groups are one of the world's largest groups.
In the last few years, people have joined the Internet to refuse the idea that the puzzles are to solve by new medical advances -- <unk> -- to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with your Windows doesn't mean it is <unk>
According to <unk> <unk> the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
Indeed, autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we are still reaching <unk> which believed that <unk> for the most autism <unk> aspects are in understanding teachers, employers with capacity, communities, communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As <unk> towards an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
